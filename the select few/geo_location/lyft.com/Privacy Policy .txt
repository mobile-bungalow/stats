                    At Lyft, we want to connect people through transportation and bring
                    communities together. In this privacy policy, we tell you what information
                    we receive from Lyft riders and drivers, and how we use it to connect
                    riders with drivers and continue to improve our services. Below, we
                    explain how you can share with other riders and drivers in the Lyft
                    community as part of our mission to bring people together.

                <h2>Scope of this Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    Lyft (“Lyft,” “we,” “our,” and/or “us”) values the privacy of individuals
                    who use our application, websites, and related services (collectively, the
                    “Lyft Platform ”). This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains how
                    we collect, use, and share information from Lyft users (“Users”),
                    comprised of both Lyft riders (“Riders”) and Lyft drivers  (including
                    Driver applicants) (“Drivers”). Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of
                    Lyft is also subject to our Terms of Service (

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                <section id="privacy-information-you-provide-to-us">
                    <h3>A.  Information You Provide to Us</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Registration Information</strong>. When you sign up for a Lyft
                        account, you give us your name, email address, and phone number. If
                        you decide to sign up for Lyft using your Facebook account, we will
                        also get basic information from your Facebook profile like your name,
                        gender, profile photo, and Facebook friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>User Profile Information</strong>. When you join the Lyft
                        community, you can create a Lyft Profile to share fun facts about
                        yourself, and discover mutual friends and interests. Filling out a
                        profile is optional, and you can share as little or as much as you
                        want. Your name (and for Drivers, Profile photos) is always part of
                        your Profile. Read more below about how you can control who sees your
                        Profile. You can also add a Business Profile to your account, which
                        requires a designated business email address and payment method.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Payment Method</strong>. When you add a credit card or payment
                        method to your Lyft account, a third party that handles payments for
                        us will receive your card information. To keep your financial data
                        secure, we do not store full credit card information on our servers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Communications</strong>. If you contact us directly, we may
                        receive additional information about you. For example, when you
                        contact our Customer Support Team, we will receive your name, email
                        address, phone number, the contents of a message or attachments that
                        you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Driver Application Information</strong>. If you decide to join
                        our Lyft driver community, in addition to the basic registration
                        information we ask you for your date of birth, physical address,
                        Social Security number, driver’s license information, vehicle
                        information, car insurance information, and in some jurisdictions we
                        may collect additional business license or permitting information. We
                        share this information with our partners who help us by running
                        background checks on Drivers to help protect the Lyft community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Payment Information</strong>. To make sure Drivers get paid,
                        we keep information about Drivers’ bank routing numbers, tax
                        information, and any other payment information provided by Drivers.

                    <h3>B.  Information We Collect When You Use the Lyft Platform</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Location Information</strong>. Lyft is all about connecting
                        Drivers and Riders. To do this, we need to know where you are. When
                        you open Lyft on your mobile device, we receive your location. We may
                        also collect the precise location of your device when the app is
                        running in the foreground or background. If you label certain
                        locations, such as “home” and “work,” we receive that information,
                        too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your location information is necessary for things like matching Riders
                        with nearby Drivers, determining drop off and pick up locations, and
                        suggesting destinations based on previous trips. Also, if the need
                        ever arises, our Trust &amp; Safety team may use and share location
                        information to help protect the safety of Lyft Users or a member of
                        the public. In addition to the reasons described above, Drivers’
                        location information and distance travelled is necessary for
                        calculating charges and insurance for Lyft rides. If you give us
                        permission through your device settings or Lyft app, we may collect
                        your location while the app is off to identify promotions or service
                        updates in your area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Device Information</strong>. Lyft receives information from
                        Users’ devices, including IP address, web browser type, mobile
                        operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, application
                        installations, device identifiers, mobile advertising identifiers,
                        push notification tokens, and, if you register with your Facebook
                        account, your Facebook identifier. We collect mobile sensor data from
                        Drivers’ devices (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration or
                        deceleration) to improve location accuracy and analyze usage patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Usage Information</strong>. To help us understand how you use
                        the Lyft Platform and to help us improve it, we automatically receive
                        information about your interactions with the Lyft Platform, like the
                        pages or other content you view, your actions within the Lyft app, and
                        the dates and times of your visits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Call and Text Information</strong>. We work with a third party
                        partner to facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and
                        Drivers who have been connected for a ride. We receive information
                        about these communications including the date and time of the call or
                        SMS message, the parties’ phone numbers, and the content of any SMS
                        messages.  For security purposes, we may also monitor and/or record
                        the contents of phone calls made on the Lyft Platform, such as those
                        between Riders and Drivers.  You will be given notice that your call
                        may be recorded, and by proceeding you agree to allow Lyft to monitor
                        and/or record your call.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>User Feedback</strong>. At Lyft, we want to make sure Users
                        are always enjoying great rides. Riders and Drivers may rate and
                        review each other at the end of every ride. We receive information
                        about ratings and reviews and, as we explain below, give Riders
                        information about Drivers’ ratings and reviews and vice versa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Address Book Contacts</strong>. If you permit Lyft to access
                        the address book on your device through the permission system used by
                        your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact
                        information from your address book to facilitate invitations and
                        social interactions that you initiate through our Platform and for
                        other purposes described in this privacy policy or at the time of
                        consent or collection.

                        <strong>Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong>. We
                        collect information through the use of “cookies”, tracking pixels, and
                        similar technologies to understand how you navigate through the Lyft
                        Platform and interact with Lyft advertisements, to learn what content
                        is popular, and to save your preferences. Cookies are small text files
                        that web servers place on your device; they are designed to store
                        basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your
                        browser.  We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A
                        session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent
                        cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every
                        time you use the Lyft Platform.  You should consult your web
                        browser(s) to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you
                        delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may be missing out
                        on certain features of the Lyft Platform.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Third Party Services</strong>. If you choose to register for
                        Lyft or otherwise link your Lyft account with a third party’s service
                        (such as Facebook), we may receive the same type of information we
                        collect from you (described above) directly from those services.

                        <strong>Third Party Partners</strong>. We may receive additional

                        or fraud detection information, from third party partners and combine
                        it with other information that we have about you.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Enterprise Programs</strong>. If your company, university, or
                        organization participates in one of our enterprise programs such as
                        Lyft for Work, we may receive information about you, such as your
                        email address, from your participating organization. We also may give
                        your participating organization the opportunity to request a ride on
                        your behalf, in which case they may provide us with your name, phone
                        number, and the pickup and drop off location for your ride.

                        <strong>Background Information on Drivers</strong>. Lyft works with

                        checks on Drivers, and we receive information from them such as
                        publicly available information about a Driver’s driving record or
                        criminal history.

                    <h3>A. Sharing Between Users</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Sharing between Riders and Drivers</strong>. Riders and Drivers that
                        have been matched for a ride are able to see basic information about
                        each other, such as names, photo, ratings, and any information they
                        have added to their Profiles. Riders and Drivers who connect their
                        Lyft accounts to Facebook will also be able to see their mutual
                        Facebook friends during the ride. Drivers see the pick-up location
                        that the Rider has provided. Riders see a Driver’s vehicle information
                        and real-time location as the Driver approaches the pick-up location.
                        Riders’ ratings of Drivers are shared with Drivers on a weekly basis.
                        We de-identify the ratings and feedback, but we can’t rule out that a
                        driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or
                        feedback.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to
                        arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or other
                        contact information with other Users.  If you report a lost or found
                        item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or
                        Driver, including sharing actual contact information with your
                        permission.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Sharing between Lyft Line Riders</strong>. If you use Lyft
                        Line, Riders who have been matched with you will be able to see your
                        name, photo and any information you have added to your Profile. If you
                        connect your Lyft account to Facebook (such as by signing up through
                        Facebook), we may show your mutual friends with other Riders who are
                        also connected via Facebook.  During the Lyft Line matching process we
                        may show photos of possible matches to you and other Riders.

                    <h3>B. Sharing Between Lyft and Third Parties</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>API and Integration Partners</strong>.  If you connect to the
                        Lyft Platform through an integration with a third party service, we
                        may share information about your use of the Lyft Platform with that
                        third party.  We may share your information with our third party
                        partners in order to receive additional information about you.  We may
                        also share your information with third party partners to create offers
                        that may be of interest to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Third Party Services</strong>.  The Lyft Platform may allow
                        you to connect with other websites, products, or services that we
                        don’t have control over (for example, we may give you the ability to
                        order a food delivery from a restaurant from within the Lyft app). If
                        you use these services, we will provide the third party with
                        information about you to allow them to provide the service to you (for
                        example, we would give the restaurant your name, phone number and
                        address to drop off the food).  We can’t speak to the privacy
                        practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to read their
                        privacy policies before deciding whether to use their services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Service Providers</strong>.  We work with third party service
                        providers to perform services on our behalf, and we may share your
                        information with such service providers to help us provide the Lyft
                        Platform, including all of the things described in Section 3 above.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Enterprise Partners</strong>.  If you participate in an
                        enterprise program and charge a ride to your organization’s billing
                        method or credits, we will provide your organization’s account holder
                        with information about your use of the Lyft Platform, including ride
                        details such as date, time, charge, and pick up and drop off
                        locations. If you create a Business Profile, at the end of each ride
                        you will have the option to designate the ride as a business ride. If
                        you do so, and your organization has a corporate account with Lyft, we
                        may share information about your use of Lyft Platform with your
                        organization including ride details such as date, time, charge, and
                        region of the trip. If you change organizations, it is your
                        responsibility to update your Business Profile with the new
                        information.  (Please remember to check and set your designation
                        settings accordingly.) If you integrate your account with an expense
                        platform (like Concur) we will share the ride details to your expense
                        account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>International Partners</strong>.  We’ve partnered with several
                        ride-sharing services around the globe so Riders can continue to find
                        rides when they open the Lyft app abroad, and Drivers can provide
                        services to international travelers in the U.S.  When we match a ride
                        with the partner, we share the same information that is shared between
                        matched Riders and Drivers on the Lyft Platform. In some cases we are
                        unable to mask your phone number if you call an international driver,
                        so please keep that in mind before using this feature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Other Sharing</strong>.  We may share your information with
                        third parties in the following cases:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            While negotiating or in relation to a change of corporate control
                            such as a restructuring, merger or sale of our assets;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If a government authority requests information and we think
                            disclosure is required or appropriate in order to comply with
                            laws, regulations, or a legal process;
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            parties if we think doing so is necessary to protect the rights,
                            property, or safety of the Lyft community, Lyft, or the public
                            (you can read more about this in our

                        <li>
                            If you signed up for a promotion with another User’s referral or

                        <li>
                            To provide information about the use of the Lyft Platform to

                            that can’t reasonably be used to identify you; and

                <p>
                    <strong>Email Subscriptions</strong>. You can always unsubscribe from our
                    commercial or promotional emails but we will still send you transactional
                    and relational emails about your account use of the Lyft Platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Text Messages</strong>. You can opt out of receiving commercial or
                    promotional text messages by texting the word END to 46080 from the mobile
                    device receiving the messages.  You may also opt out of receiving all
                    texts from Lyft (including transactional or relational messages) by
                    texting the word STOPALL to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the
                    messages, however, opting out of receiving all texts may impact your use
                    of the Lyft Platform.  Drivers can also opt out of driver-specific
                    messages by texting STOP in response to a driver SMS.  To re-enable texts
                    you can text START in response to an unsubscribe confirmation SMS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Push Notifications</strong>.  You can opt out of receiving push
                    notifications through your device settings.  Please note that opting out
                    of receiving push notifications may impact your use of the Lyft Platform
                    (such as receiving a notification that your ride has arrived).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Profile Information</strong>. While your name will always be
                    shared with Drivers and fellow Lyft Line Riders, you can delete any
                    additional information that you added to your Profile at any time if you
                    don’t want Drivers and Lyft Line Riders to see it. Riders will always be
                    able to see Drivers’ names, rating, profile photos, and vehicle
                    information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Location Information</strong>. While you can prevent your device
                    from sharing location information at any time through your Device’s
                    operating system settings, Rider and Driver location is core to the Lyft
                    Platform and without it we can’t provide our services to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Facebook Friends</strong>. You can control whether to enable or
                    disable the Facebook mutual friends feature through your profile settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Editing and Accessing Your Information</strong>. You can review
                    and edit certain account information by logging in to your account
                    settings and profile (Drivers may edit additional information through the
                    Driver portal). If would like to terminate your Lyft account, please
                    contact us through our <a href="https://help.lyft.com/">Help
                    Center</a> with your request. If you choose to terminate your account, we
                    will deactivate it for you but may retain information from your account
                    for a certain period of time and disclose it in a manner consistent with
                    our practices under this Privacy Policy for accounts that are not closed.
                    We also may retain information from your account to collect any fees owed,
                    resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, analyze usage of the Lyft

                    of Service, or take other actions as required or permitted by law.
