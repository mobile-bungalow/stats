<p>Welcome to the terms of use for Amazon Prime Video. These terms are between you and the entity providing the Amazon Prime Video service to you, which may be, depending on your location, Amazon Digital Services LLC, Amazon Video Limited or one of their affiliates (“Amazon”, “we” or “us”). Visit <a href="/legal/en/ref=atv_hp_cnt" target="_blank">www.primevideo.com/ww-av-legal-home</a> to identify the Amazon affiliate that provides the Amazon Prime Video service to you and other applicable terms based on your location. Your Amazon Prime Video service provider may change from time to time, with or without prior notice (unless required by applicable law). Please read these terms, along with the <a href="/legal/en/ref=atv_hp_cnt" target="_blank">Privacy Notice</a>, <a href="/legal/en/ref=atv_hp_cnt" target="_blank">Conditions of Use</a>, and <a href="/usage/en/ref=atv_hp_cnt" target="_blank">Amazon Prime Video Usage Rules</a> applicable to you), and all other rules and policies related to the Amazon Prime Video service (including, but not limited to, any rules or usage provisions specified on any product detail page or on any help or other informational page for the Amazon Prime Video service) (collectively, this "Agreement"). If you are located in the European Union, the <a href="/legal/en/ref=atv_hp_cnt">Privacy Notice</a>, the Cookies Notice and the Interest-Based Ads Notice are not part of your Agreement. The versions of these policies and notices applicable to you are available for your review to understand how we handle your personal information.Each time you visit, browse, or use the Amazon Prime Video service, you accept this Agreement. </p><p>
 <b>1. THE SERVICE</b></p><p>
 Amazon Prime Video (the "Service") is a personalized service that offers, recommends and helps you discover digital movies, television shows and other video content (collectively, "Digital Content") and other services as provided in this Agreement. There are several ways to access the Service and Digital Content, including through Amazon Prime and your use of other Prime benefits and Amazon services are governed by separate terms made available in the apps, websites or devices you use to access those services. If you are under 18 years of age, or the age of majority in your location, you may use the Service only with involvement of a parent or guardian. We personalize content and features as part of the Services, including showing you recommendations on Digital Content, features and services that might be of interest to you. We also endeavor to continuously improve the Amazon devices and services and your experience with them. </p>
<p><b>2. COMPATIBLE DEVICES</b></p><p>
 In order to stream or download Digital Content, you will need to use a personal computer, portable media player, or other device that meets the system and compatibility requirements that we establish from time to time (a "Compatible Device"). Some Compatible Devices may be used only to stream Digital Content, some may be used only to download Digital Content, and some may be used to stream and download Digital Content. We may change the requirements for Compatible Devices from time to time and, in some cases, whether a device is (or remains) a Compatible Device may depend on software or systems provided or maintained by the device manufacturer or other third parties. Accordingly, devices that are Compatible Devices at one time may cease to be Compatible Devices in the future. The Amazon entity that provides you the Amazon Prime Video mobile app may be different than the Amazon entity that provides you the Service. </p><p>
 <b>3. GEOGRAPHIC VARIABILITY</b></p><p>
 Due to technical and other restrictions imposed by content providers, the Service is available only in certain locations. The Digital Content (including subtitled and dubbed audio versions of Digital Content) and how we offer Digital Content to you will vary over time and by location. Amazon will use technologies to verify your geographic location. You may not use any technology or technique to obscure or disguise your location. </p><p>
 <b>4. DIGITAL CONTENT </b></p><p>
 <b>a. General. </b>The Service may allow you to: (i) access Digital Content on a subscription basis for viewing during a limited period of time during a subscription period (for example, through Amazon Prime or other subscription or standalone video subscription offering) ("Subscription Digital Content"), (ii) rent Digital Content for on-demand viewing over a limited period of time ("Rental Digital Content"), (iii) purchase Digital Content for on-demand viewing over an indefinite period of time ("Purchased Digital Content"), (iv) purchase Digital Content for pay-per-view viewing over a limited period of time (“PPV Digital Content”), and/or (v) access Digital Content on a free, ad-supported or promotional basis for viewing over a limited period of time ("Free Digital Content"). Digital Content may be available as Subscription Digital Content, Rental Digital Content, Purchased Digital Content, PPV Digital Content, Free Digital Content, or any combination of those, and in each case is subject to the limited license grant below. </p><p>
 <b>b. Usage Rules.</b> Your use of Digital Content is subject to the <a href="/usage/en/ref=atv_hp_cnt" target="_blank">Amazon Prime Video Usage Rules</a> (the "Usage Rules"). The Usage Rules provide important information, including the time period during which you are authorized to view different types of Digital Content (the “Viewing Period”) and limitations on the number and type of Compatible Devices on which each type of Digital Content may be downloaded, streamed, and viewed.</p><p>
 <b>c. Subscriptions/Memberships.</b> Offers and pricing for subscriptions (also referred to at times as memberships), the subscription services, the extent of available Subscription Digital Content, and the specific titles available through subscription services, may change over time and by location without notice (except as may be required by applicable law). Unless otherwise indicated, any price changes are effective as of the beginning of the next subscription period. If you do not agree to a subscription change, you may cancel your subscription per Section 4(d) below. The pricing for subscriptions or memberships may include VAT and/or other taxes. Where applicable, such taxes will be collected by the party with whom you transact for the service, which may be Amazon or a third party. We make no guarantee as to the availability of specific Subscription Digital Content or the minimum amount of Subscription Digital Content available in any subscription. Additional terms applicable to a subscription (such as the applicable cancellation and refund policy) will be indicated on the informational pages for that subscription on the primary Service website for your location, noted <a href="/legal/en/ref=atv_hp_cnt" target="_blank">here</a> (your “Video Marketplace”). </p><p>
 Some of the subscription services that we offer are from third parties. Third parties that provide subscription services (for example, through Prime Video Channels) may change or discontinue the features of their services or the content in their services. Amazon is not responsible for the content contained in any third-party subscription service or the features of these services. </p><p>
 <b>d. Cancellation of Subscriptions/Memberships</b> </p><p>
 You may cancel a video-only subscription or membership service any time by visiting Your Account and adjusting your membership settings, by contacting Amazon customer service, or by using any cancellation form that we make available to you on your Video Marketplace (noted <a href="/legal/en/ref=atv_hp_cnt" target="_blank">here</a>) or, if you transact for the applicable Amazon subscription or membership service through a third party, through your account with such third party. If you cancel within 3 business days of signing up for, or converting from a free trial to, a paid membership (or, for customers in the European Union, within 14 days of receiving confirmation of your subscription or membership service), we will refund your full membership fee; except that we may charge you (or withhold from your refund) the value of the Service used through your account during such period. You also expressly accept that the Service will start within your cancellation period. If you cancel at any other time, we will refund your full membership fee only if Digital Content available as part of your video-only membership has not been accessed through your account since your latest membership charge. If you are accessing the Service as part of a Prime membership, the cancellation and refund terms that apply to you are set forth in the Prime Terms of Use of your Video Marketplace (noted <a href="/legal/en/ref=atv_hp_cnt" target="_blank">here</a>). If you are accessing the Service as part of an Amazon subscription or membership that you transact for through a third party, the cancellation and refund terms that apply to you may differ and are as set forth by such third party.</p><p>
 <b>e. Purchase and Rental Transactions; Cancellations. </b>Except as described in this paragraph, all transactions for Purchased Digital Content, Rental Digital Content and PPV Digital Content are final, and we do not accept returns of such Digital Content. You may cancel an order for Purchased Digital Content or Rental Digital Content within 48 hours of purchase or rental (or, for customers in the European Union, within 14 days from the date of purchase or rental) by clicking “Cancel Your Order” from Your Digital Orders on your Video Marketplace (noted <a href="/legal/en/ref=atv_hp_cnt" target="_blank">here</a>) or by contacting Amazon customer service; except that you may not cancel an order for Purchased Digital Content or Rental Digital Content once you have started watching or downloading such Digital Content. You may cancel a pre-order for Purchased Digital Content or Rental Digital Content any time before its release date. You may cancel an order for PPV Digital Content any time before the scheduled start of the program. The release date of pre-ordered Digital Content is subject to change.</p><p>
 <b>f. Payment Methods.</b> If we are unable to process your payment using your designated payment method, we reserve the right to charge any payment method we have on file for you. If you purchase a subscription or start a free trial for a subscription, your subscription will automatically continue, and you authorize us (without further notice, unless required by applicable law) to collect the then-applicable periodic subscription fee including any taxes, using any payment method we have on file for you. We will continue to bill you for the relevant subscription service until cancelled. If all payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment of your subscription fee, your subscription will be cancelled unless you provide us with a new payment method. If you provide us with a new payment method and are successfully charged before your subscription is cancelled, your new subscription period will be based on the original billing date and not the date of the successful charge. You can use “Your Account” settings to update your designated payment method(s). </p><p>
 <b>g. Promotional Trials.</b> We sometimes offer eligible customers various trial or other promotional memberships, which are subject to this Agreement except as otherwise stated in the promotional offers. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to determine your eligibility. Trial members may at any time (through Your Account) choose not to continue to paid membership at the end of the trial period.</p><p>
 <b>h. Limited License to Digital Content.</b> Subject to payment of any charges to rent, purchase, or access Digital Content, and your compliance with all terms of this Agreement, Amazon grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited license, during the applicable Viewing Period, to access and view the Digital Content in accordance with the Usage Rules, for personal, non-commercial, private use. We may automatically remove Digital Content from your Compatible Device after the end of its Viewing Period.</p><p>
 <b>i. Availability of Purchased Digital Content.</b> Purchased Digital Content will generally continue to be available to you for download or streaming from the Service, as applicable, but may become unavailable due to potential content provider licensing restrictions or for other reasons, and Amazon will not be liable to you if Purchased Digital Content becomes unavailable for further download or streaming. You may download and store your own copy of Purchased Digital Content on a Compatible Device authorized for such download so that you can view that Purchased Digital Content if it becomes unavailable for further download or streaming from the Service.</p><p>
 <b>j. Downloading and Risk of Loss.</b> If you plan to download Digital Content that you purchase or rent for on-demand viewing, we encourage you to do so promptly after your purchase or rental. If you are unable to complete a download after having reviewed our online help resources, please contact Amazon customer service. Once you purchase or rent such Digital Content and we make the Digital Content available to you, you are responsible for completing the download, if you choose to download, and for all risk of loss of the Digital Content.</p><p>
 <b>k. Playback Quality; Streaming.</b> The playback resolution and quality of the Digital Content you receive will depend on a number of factors, including the type of Compatible Device on which you are accessing the Digital Content and your bandwidth, which may increase or decrease over the course of your viewing. If we detect that Digital Content we are streaming to you may be interrupted or may otherwise not play properly due to bandwidth constraints or other factors, we may decrease the resolution and file size of the streamed Digital Content in an effort to provide an uninterrupted viewing experience. While we strive to provide you a high quality viewing experience, we make no guarantee as to the resolution or quality of the Digital Content you will receive when streaming, even if you have paid extra for access to high definition, ultra-high definition, or high-dynamic-range content. </p><p>
 <b>l. General Restrictions.</b> You may not (i) transfer, copy or display the Digital Content, except as permitted in this Agreement; (ii) sell, rent, lease, distribute, or broadcast any right to the Digital Content; (iii) remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Digital Content; (iv) attempt to disable, bypass, modify, defeat, or otherwise circumvent any digital rights management or other content protection system used as part of the Service; or (v) use the Service or Digital Content for any commercial or illegal purpose.</p><p>
