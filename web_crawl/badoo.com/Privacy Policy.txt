<h1>Privacy Policy</h1><h2>Who we are</h2>

<p>Badoo is operated by Badoo Trading Limited, a company registered in England at The Broadgate Tower Third Floor, 20 Primrose Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 2RS and company number 07540255.</p>

<p>Badoo has designated a Data Protection Officer and they can be reached by emailing DPO@badoo.com or by post at the address above.</p><h2>What information does Badoo process?</h2>

<p>Badoo is a meeting place for adults, and we provide that service by operating a social network site offering users the opportunity to connect to our global community of users. By joining Badoo, you enter a legal agreement with us and we process your data in order to provide your service under the terms of that agreement. You can only become a member of Badoo or use its features if youre aged 18 or over or the age of majority in the country in which you reside if that happens to be greater than 18.</p>

<p>To join the Badoo network you will have to complete our online registration form, where we may ask you to provide us with information about you such as your name, your email address, your gender, your date of birth, your location details. You also have the opportunity to provide other details about yourself, but these are optional. Because you control your user profile, these details are available to you at any time by accessing your Profile page, which gives you the chance to correct or update (other than your email address and gender) your information at any time by just logging in to Badoo. You can contact Badoo's Customer Support Team at <a href="http://badoo.com/feedback">Feedback Page</a> to change the gender on your profile and/or email address.</p><p>Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your Profile such as your religious denomination and health details. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your Profile, including your sexual preferences and ethnic background, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs or any video clips that you post on Badoo may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive data about yourself, you are explicitly consenting to our processing your information and making this public to other users.</p><p>For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, we require users to verify their accounts and might ask for your phone number. We want to make sure you are not a robot! And we also want to avoid fake Badoo accounts being created which can be used for malicious activities and cyber crime  they threaten the Badoo network and spoil things for everyone. We use a third party provider for account verification who will keep your phone number for up to 90 days for fraud identification purposes across a range of online platforms and services like Badoos. We collect and use your phone number on the basis of our legitimate interests identified above and for the prevention of fraud.</p><p>If you decide to purchase any of our premium services, we will process your payment information and retain this securely for the prevention of fraud and for audit/tax purposes.  Under data protection law, it is necessary for us to collect and process this payment data to enable us to perform our contract with you and our ongoing retention of this data is justified by our legitimate interests set out above.</p>

<p>To enable Badoo to provide a free non-premium service, we process some limited data (demographics and location) to drive targeted advertising in our legitimate interest including sharing such data with advertising networks. You can stop this within Settings but you will still see adverts though they will be less relevant to you. Through your devices security settings you also have the option to prevent or limit device identifiers being shared with third party advertisers and what use is made of the device identifiers. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">this page</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we want to keep in touch with you to make sure you know about the great promotions and offers we have available. If youve told us its OK, we will use your email address and phone number to send you information on these. You can withdraw this consent at any time via Settings in the app or website.</p><h2>What does Badoo collect about me if I use the mobile App?</h2>

<p>Badoo offers you the opportunity to stay in touch with the friends and contacts youve made no matter where you are. You can do this by using your mobile phone or by downloading an application to your desktop that allows you to share your location with other users.</p>
<p>When you use your mobile or the desktop application, we will collect information about WiFi access points as well as other location information about your longitude and latitude. That information helps us identify your physical location so that it can be displayed and shared with other members choosing to view nearby posts.</p>

<p>If you have enabled location services, but wish to turn it off, you can do so by the following methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>iPhone app  settings, privacy, location services, Badoo</li>
<li>Android  profile, privacy, off</li>
</ol>

<p>We, or our third-party advertising partners, may also collect and use your device identifier to serve relevant ads to you through the App. You can opt out of targeted advertising by (i) becoming payers and/ or (ii) opting not to share data with any partner platforms but still to receive advertisements.</p><h2>How long will Badoo keep my data?</h2>

<p>If you have not logged on to your account for a period of 30 months, your profile and any pictures will be deleted. Where you request that your profile is deleted via the app or website, it is immediately made unavailable and fully deleted within 30 days.</p>
<p>Correspondence with our Customer Support team will be retained for longer to allow us to deal with any subsequent queries you may have but will usually be deleted within 6 years if there are no queries.</p>
<p>Anonymised information about activity on Badoo is retained for longer for statistical and product research purposes but this is not attributable to an individual once the profile has been deleted.</p>
<p>Information such as payment information, IP addresses, mobile numbers and email addresses are retained for anti-fraud and anti-spam purposes for as long as they are relevant. This is usually determined by the expiry of the payment method.</p><h2>What information does Badoo collect about me if Im under 18?</h2>

<p>Badoo does not knowingly collect any information about or market to children, minors or anyone under the age of majority. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal data, we will take steps to terminate that persons registration and delete their Profile information from Badoo. If we do delete a Profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new Profile.</p><h2>What information does Badoo collect about my friends and contacts?</h2>

<p>You can choose to invite your friends to join Badoo to make sure that they also get the benefits of meeting new people. To make it easier to search and find friends and acquaintances on Badoo, users may search for other members by email address. If you want to invite your friends and contacts to Badoo, we will send an email invitation from Badoo in your name or you can send an SMS (if you use our Android or iPhone App) to your friends and contacts encouraging them to sign up to Badoo. If any of the individuals you have invited do not register within a few days, Badoo may occasionally send reminder emails on your behalf to those individuals. You can choose to invite all your friends or only a select few by simply unticking the names of those friends you do not wish to invite, but please remember you must not invite any children to join. You are responsible for ensuring that your friend has agreed to receiving a Badoo invite.</p>

<p>When you import your contacts, we store their name and email address or their mobile number so that we can automatically connect you and your friend. Badoo does not sell these email addresses or mobile numbers or use them to send any other communication besides email invitations. The friend may contact Badoo to request the removal of their information from our database by visiting <a href="http://badoo.com/feedback">Feedback Page</a>. Any such request will only apply to addresses or mobile numbers we have at the time of the request and not to any addresses or mobile numbers that the member/user provides to us later.</p><h2>Who does Badoo share information with?</h2>

<p>We may share aggregated information with such parties as Foursquare that includes your personal data (but which doesnt identify you directly), together with other information including log data with third parties for industry analysis and demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.</p>
<p>We share your data with the following categories of third-parties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information technology companies (hardware and software) which provide services to support our products</li>
<li>Fraud prevention and anti-spam providers to protect the service from criminal activity</li>
<li>Moderators to monitor activity on the site/apps and approve content</li>
<li>Advertising partners, market places and providers of targeted advertising, including, but not limited to, MoPub Inc. (you can view MoPubs privacy policy at https://www.mopub.com/legal/privacy/ and its partner list at https://www.mopub.com/legal/partners/)</li>
<li>Law enforcement agencies, where we are required to by law or to protect the vital interests of a person</li>
<li>Payment processing and telecommunications companies to facilitate payments for our premium services</li>
</ol>

<p>We ensure these parties must adhere to strict data protection and confidentiality provisions that are consistent with this Policy. Measures are taken to ensure that the data shared is non-attributable to the greatest extent possible.</p>

<p>In the event that Badoo or any of its affiliates undergoes a business transition or change of ownership, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, re- organisation, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, or in the event of insolvency or administration, we may be required to disclose your personal data.</p><h2>How does lookalikes work?</h2>

<p>Lookalikes is one feature of the site which is primarily designed to allow you to find people who look similar to celebrities, friends or even you! The feature will return photos of people who look like the person you searched for and who are existing members of Badoo. After using the feature you will be invited to create a Badoo account so that you can contact these lookalikes and possibly meet (only if they agree of course!).</p>

<p>We respect other peoples rights, and you should too. We recognise that as well as uploading a photo of yourself to find your lookalike, you may wish to upload a photo of someone else to find their lookalikes. If you do, then you should get their permission before you upload their photo. You are not permitted to upload photos of children.</p>

<p>Any photo is held for 30 days. After this time it will automatically be purged from our servers. If you wish for the photo to be deleted before then (e.g. you have been contacted by the person in the photo you uploaded seeking immediate removal of the photo), you may contact us via email at <a href="mailto:lookalike@badoo.com">lookalike@badoo.com</a> to make your request. Please be aware that it may take up to 72 hours for us to process your request.</p><h2>Your rights</h2>
