When we mention Badoo, we mean www.badoo.com, together with affiliated websites and applications.</p>
<p>The Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you as user (<b>you</b>) and the Badoo Group (we or us).

<p>Please use your common sense when picking the Content that you choose to post on, upload or send via Badoo because you are solely responsible for, and bear all liability in relation to, such Content. If you repeatedly infringe our rules, you may be prevented from using Badoo and we may disable your account or block you from further use of Badoo. We may remove any Content you submit to Badoo if we believe it violates the Terms or we are required to do so by applicable law.</p><h3>Are there any rules relating to personal data like my email address?</h3>

<p>You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your individual profile page (<b>Profile</b>) whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details, or place of work). If you do choose to reveal any personal data about yourself to other users, whether via email or otherwise, it is at your own risk. We encourage you to use the same caution in disclosing details about yourself to third parties online as you would under any other circumstances. You are required to follow our <a href="https://badoo.com/guidelines/">Guidelines and Safety Tips</a> when doing so.</p><h3>What about other peoples personal data, can I use it?</h3>

<p>You may only use other Badoo users personal data to the extent that your use of it matches Badoos purpose of allowing people to meet one another. When using Badoo Live, you may not film other people, whether or not they are Badoo users, unless you have informed them that the footage will be livestreamed via Badoo Live and given them an opportunity to exclude themselves from the footage. You may not use other users' information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. Badoo reserves the right to terminate your account, or prevent access to its features if you misuse other users' information.</p><h3>Some of my friends want to see all the people Im chatting with. Can I tell them my password and let them log on as me?</h3>

<p>The short answer is no. Only you are authorised to access your account with Badoo.

If you suspect that someone has gained access to your account, you must let us know immediately by visiting <a href="https://badoo.com/feedback/">Feedback page</a> and telling us of your suspicions or concerns. You must also immediately change your password. Badoo reserves the right to terminate your account if you violate our rules on keeping your password secure.</p><h3>Who can see the Content that I put on Badoo?</h3>

<p>When you upload Content to Badoo it can be accessed and viewed by the general public. If you do not want such Content to be viewed by others, then you can opt to use the private folders and select the person to whom you wish to give access. If you still do not want such Content to be viewed by others, then you should not upload it to Badoo. We reserve the right (without obligation) at our sole discretion and without giving you notice, to remove or edit, limit or block access to any Content that you upload or submit to Badoo without any incurring liability to you. We have no obligation to display any Content that you submit to Badoo, nor to check the accuracy or truthfulness of any Content submitted to Badoo, nor to monitor your use or the use of other users of Badoo.</p><h3>Anything else I need to know?</h3>

<h3>Do you guarantee that Badoo will be up and running at all times?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately we cant guarantee that because sometimes we have to carry out maintenance to the app or site or they may be affected by a fault or circumstances which are outside our control, so Badoo is provided on an as is as available basis. No warranty is given about the quality, accuracy, functionality, availability or performance of Badoo and we reserve the right to suspend, withdraw, amend, modify or vary the service provided on Badoo without notice and without incurring any liability to you.</p><h3>What about mobile access?</h3>

<p>You are responsible for making all the necessary arrangements to ensure you can access Badoo (including, but not limited to Internet provider and mobile internet provider fees and, any other charges associated with such access). We shall not be held responsible for any reduced functionality you may encounter as result of or in connection with accessing Badoo through mobile services or any similar service currently known or developed in the future.</p>
<p>By accessing Badoo or agreeing to receive messages or notifications from Badoo through your mobile phone and/or any other connected media device, you accept that you may incur charges from your internet or mobile service provider. We shall not under any circumstances be liable for such charges.</p><h3>Im not registered and I cant seem to access some Content or features on the app or site. Why is that?</h3>

<p>Non-registered users are able to access only that portion of Badoo that is publicly available. They will not have a Profile but may have limited ability to upload any Content. The extent of registered users access to Badoo will depend on certain criteria relating to their Profile being met. We may change or update the criteria from time to time without prior notice and at our discretion.</p><h2>5. Lookalikes</h2>

<h3>How does Lookalikes work?</h3>

<p>Lookalikes is one feature of the site which is primarily designed to allow you to find people who look similar to celebrities, friends or even you! The feature will return photos of people who look like the person you searched for and who are existing members of Badoo. After using the feature you will be invited to create a Badoo account so that you can contact these lookalikes and possibly meet (only if they agree of course!).</p>

<p>If you do use Lookalikes to upload a photo, please remember to remind yourself of our rules on what Content you may upload.</p><h3>What about other peoples rights when I upload a photo?</h3>

<p>We respect other peoples rights, and you should too. We recognise that as well as uploading a photo of yourself to find your lookalike you may wish to upload a photo of someone else to find their lookalike. If you do, then you should get their permission before you upload their photo.</p>

<p>Equally, you should not infringe someone elses intellectual property rights. For further details on this, please refer to the section What kind of content can I post or upload on Badoo?.</p><h3>Who can see the photo that I upload on Lookalikes?</h3>

<p>When you upload a photo to Lookalikes, you may share it with our partners, such as Facebook and Twitter where your photo will be visible on those social media platforms. We are not responsible for, nor do we run these sites, so remember to check their respective privacy policies and terms of use.</p><h2>6. Badoo Live</h2>

<h3>How does Badoo Live work?</h3>

<p>Badoo Live enables you to create, transmit and view live stream audiovisual content. If you use Badoo Live please remind yourself of our rules on which content you may upload and ensure that you comply with those rules when carrying out any live streaming.</p>
<p>Badoo will rate the quality of the live stream based on a number of factors and may credit the broadcasters account with tokens where the live stream achieves a certain rating as determined by Badoo acting in its sole discretion.</p><h3>How do Broadcasters Redeem Tokens?</h3>

<p>Tokens can be used to acquire credits to access Badoos premium services or to cash-out for actual currency should you meet certain conditions as detailed here in and in the cash-out rules accessible via your account.</p>
<p>Tokens are redeemable 90 days after being earned. The minimum amount required for cash-out and maximum amount of permissible cash out are detailed in the cash-out rules.</p>
<p>The currency of cash-out will be determined by Badoo applying its then current exchange rate which it may change in its sole discretion.  Cash-outs may be subject to deductions for refunds and or chargebacks.
Badoos exchange rate may also change due to the fluctuating value of tokens, which may change between the time they were awarded and the time you decide to cash-out.</p>
<p>Badoo may amend the value of any cash out or withhold any cash-out at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>You must have an active PayPal account or bank account to cash-out. We will not make payment to sanctioned countries.</p>
<p>Your account will be linked to your user account when you cash-out and the payment will be processed following any cash-out request according to the terms of Paypal or your bank. The time until pay-out varies and depends on a number of factors including the terms of Paypal or your bank. Note that Paypal may place any funds in temporary hold where there is insufficient payment history. In such cases, please contact Paypal.</p>
<p>Badoo does not charge a withdrawal fee to cash-out, however transaction fees of Paypal or your bank or FX rates may apply.</p>
<p>Note you are solely responsible for checking the terms of service of Paypal or your bank for policy details and applicability of transaction fees.</p>
<p>Tokens expire 12 months after becoming redeemable.</p><h3>Taxes</h3>
<p>The broadcaster shall be solely responsible for all taxes payable in respect of the cash-out and shall indemnify Badoo and its group companies against any tax liability which arises out of or in connection with the cash-out and Badoo may satisfy such amounts by way of deduction from the amount due.</p>
<p>Tax regulations may require Badoo to collect appropriate tax information from broadcasters or to withhold taxes from payouts in which case we reserve the right to freeze payouts or withhold such amounts as required by law.</p><h3>Fraud and Termination</h3>

<p>All cash-out transactions will be reviewed by Badoo. Badoo takes fraud extremely seriously.</p>

<p>If Badoo terminates your account for cause (including fraud), any outstanding tokens remaining in your account at the time of termination may be irrevocably confiscated, as determined by Badoo in its sole and absolute discretion, in accordance with our termination policy specified below.</p><h3>What about other peoples rights when I upload live streaming content?</h3>

<p>The rights of others in your live stream content are important and we respect them (and expect that you do too).</p>
<p>We have undertaken a legitimate interests assessment. The outcome of this assessment is that, whilst it should not be necessary to obtain a clear consent from any third parties in your livestream content, we require you to notify all third parties prior to shooting the footage, and provide them with an adequate opportunity to be excluded themselves from the footage. When uploading livestream content to Badoo, you are warranting that you have done so.</p><h2>7. Termination of use by us</h2>

<h3>My Profile has disappeared and I cant log in. Whats going on?</h3>

<p>Sometimes people forget about the Terms and post Content or act in a way while on Badoo which is not consistent with the purpose of the app or site. If we think that you may be one of those people, then we reserve the right at our sole discretion, at any time and without liability or the need to give you prior notice or to refund any unused services to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>suspend or revoke your registration (where applicable) and your right to access and/or use Badoo or submit any Content to Badoo; and</li>
<li>make use of any operational, technological, legal, or other means available to enforce the Terms (including without limitation blocking specific IP addresses).</li>
</ol>
<p>We will try (but we are not obliged) to notify you if your access to Badoo and/or your Profile is to be or has been suspended or terminated. Where you have acted contrary to our Terms, we will keep a record of it and may block future attempts by you to use or access Badoo and its features so that we can keep Badoo a fun place.</p><h2>8. Termination of use by you</h2>

<h3>They say that you can have too much of a good thing what do I do if I want to unregister myself from Badoo?</h3>

<p>If you have registered on Badoo, you can terminate your registration at any time by going to the Settings control on Badoo when you are logged in and choosing the delete profile link. We save your profile information in case you later decide to restore your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to Badoo. You will therefore be able to restore your account and your profile in its entirety within 30 days of de-activating it. Once your registration is terminated, we have the right to delete any related Content that you have submitted or uploaded on to Badoo. For further details, please refer to our <a href="https://badoo.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Content that you have uploaded to Badoo, other than your Profile (such as comments or email messages), may still appear on Badoo following termination of your registration.</p><h2>9. Abuse/Complaints</h2>
