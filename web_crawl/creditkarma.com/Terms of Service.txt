    <p ck-text="">Welcome to the Credit Karma community! We're excited to provide all sorts of free tools and insight to help you better understand your credit and feel more empowered by your finances.</p>

    <p ck-text="">When you use Credit Karma, you enter into a legal agreement, which is what you see below.  While we've tried to make this agreement as clear as possible, it still contains a fair bit of legalese, out of necessity. To help you navigate this legalese, we’ve included a few extra notes alongside the actual terms of the agreement, which we’ve highlighted and labeled as “Summaries”. These Summaries are <strong>not</strong> a part of the agreement itself; they are only included to help you understand it. <strong>We've also bolded a few areas that talk about important legal rights, including the following:</strong></p>

    <p ck-text=""><strong>These Terms of Service include an agreement to resolve any disputes through binding arbitration that includes a class action waiver, as well as important disclaimers, warranties and limitations on liability.</strong></p>

You can contact us <a href="mailto:legal@creditkarma.com">here</a> or by U.S. mail at Credit Karma, Inc., P.O. Box 520, San Francisco, CA 94104-0520, Attention: Legal Department.

    <blockquote class="ck-terms-brief">
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Our most helpful features require you to register as a Credit Karma member (it helps us personalize your experience). If you decide to register, you're pinky swearing that you're a U.S. adult, you are who you say you are and you won't let anyone else use your account.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">2.2 Specific Registration Consents</h4>

    <h3 ck-header="copy" id="tosLimitations">3. Limitations and Restrictions on Use of Our Services</h3>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">3.1 Analysis and Estimates</h4>

    <p ck-text="">As described in our <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/about/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, we may use your credit report, credit score, and other information we obtain to analyze, sort, and present certain information or features to you.</p>

    <p ck-text="">Any analysis and estimates we provide as part of our Services are for illustrative and informational purposes only. Our analysis and estimates are based on certain assumptions and use only the data we have. Our analysis and estimates are neither endorsed by, nor commissioned by, any of our partners. The methodology we use to determine which offers, analysis, or other information is presented or highlighted is proprietary and we may elect to consider, ignore, emphasize, or de-emphasize certain factors in our sole and absolute discretion. </p>

    <blockquote class="ck-terms-brief">
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>When it comes to your financial health, we want to be like a river guide who helps you navigate the financial waters. We'll show you stuff you may find helpful, but it's up to you to make the final decision about what’s in your financial interest.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">3.2 Third Party Offers</h4>

    <p ck-text="">With respect to offers from our partners, we do not guarantee that you will be presented with offers for any particular types of products or services or that you will meet the approval criteria for any particular offer. It is always your choice whether to apply for a product or service offered by our partners and we will never submit an application for a product or service to a partner on your behalf without your consent.</p>


    <h4 ck-header="copy smallx">3.3 Educational Purposes</h4>

    <p ck-text="">All information on our Services is presented for educational purposes only. We do not guarantee that the information we present as part of our Services, including credit report or credit score information, is the same information that may be used or reviewed by a third party to assess your creditworthiness or eligibility for any particular product or service or for employment.</p>

    <blockquote class="ck-terms-brief">
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The credit scores that lenders and others use may be different than the one you see here. That's because there are hundreds of scoring models out there, and they all weigh things a little differently. Most scores are generally based on similar credit factors though, so tracking one or two should still give you a good overview of your credit health.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">3.4 Not a Legal or Professional Advisor</h4>

    <p ck-text="">Credit Karma is not a credit repair organization, credit counselor, or financial or legal advisor as defined under federal or state law. Use of our Services is not a replacement for personal, professional advice or assistance regarding your finances, credit history or fixing your credit rating.</p>

    <blockquote class="ck-terms-brief">
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>We aim to be as helpful as we can, but we're not your professional financial or legal advisor. If you need professional assistance with your finances, please go to a professional that can help with your specific situation.</p>

    <h3 ck-header="copy" id="tosDisputes">10. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h3>

    <blockquote class="ck-terms-brief">
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>A third party arbitrator will help us resolve any disputes we might have. This means that any dispute will be resolved outside of class-action litigation. Hopefully, disputes will never be an issue, but you should read this section carefully for details on how it works.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">10.1 Generally</h4>

    <p ck-text="">In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Credit Karma in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Credit Karma agree that every dispute arising in connection with the Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration. You and us further agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of the Agreement. The arbitrator also has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>

    <p ck-text=""><strong>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENT, YOU AND CREDIT KARMA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</strong></p>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">10.2 Exceptions </h4>

    <p ck-text="">Despite the provisions of Section 10.1, you and us both agree that nothing in the Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court within its jurisdictional limits; (b) file a complaint with the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file a suit in a court of law solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of our Services or address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">10.3 Arbitrator</h4>

    <p ck-text="">Any arbitration between you and Credit Karma will be governed by the FAA, the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "<strong>AAA Rules</strong>") of the American Arbitration Association ("<strong>AAA</strong>"), as modified by the Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Credit Karma <a href="mailto:legal@creditkarma.com">here</a>.</p>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">10.4 Notice and Process</h4>

    <p ck-text="">A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other by certified mail ("<strong>Notice</strong>"). Credit Karma's address for Notice is: Credit Karma, Inc., P.O. Box 520, San Francisco, CA 94104-0520, Attention: Legal Department. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("<strong>Demand</strong>"). You and Credit Karma agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and Credit Karma do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or us may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Credit Karma must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Credit Karma's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, Credit Karma will pay you the amount awarded by the arbitrator or fifteen thousand United States dollars ($15,000), whichever is greater. The arbitration proceedings, including any exchanged materials, shall be confidential and you and Credit Karma agree to use reasonable efforts to streamline the proceedings, including discovery, consistent with the objectives of efficient dispute resolution.</p>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">10.5 Fees</h4>

    <p ck-text="">If you commence arbitration in accordance with the Agreement, Credit Karma will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, or as otherwise required, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your registered account address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Credit Karma for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. </p>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">10.6 No Class Actions </h4>

    <p ck-text=""><strong>YOU AND CREDIT KARMA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. </strong></p>

    <p ck-text="">Further, unless both you and Credit Karma agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">10.7 Modifications</h4>

    <p ck-text="">If Credit Karma makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Credit Karma's address for Notice), you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Credit Karma's address for Notice, in which case your account with Credit Karma will be immediately terminated but this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive.</p>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">10.8 Enforceability</h4>

    <p ck-text="">If any provision of this Section 10 is unlawful, void, or unenforceable for any reason, then that provision will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">12.4 Waiver Only in Writing</h4>

    <p ck-text="">Credit Karma's failure to enforce any of its rights or act with respect to a breach by you or others of the Agreement does not constitute a waiver of any rights and will not limit Credit Karma's rights with respect to that breach or any subsequent breaches. No waiver by Credit Karma of any of the provisions in the Agreement will be of any force or effect unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of Credit Karma. </p>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">12.5 Assignment</h4>

    <p ck-text="">Credit Karma may assign the Agreement to any party at any time without notice to you. You may not assign your rights under the Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our consent. </p>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">12.6 Severability</h4>

    <p ck-text="">If any provision of the Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable for any reason, then that provision will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. <strong>Nothing in the Agreement shall affect any non-waivable statutory rights or remedies that apply to you.</strong></p>

    <h4 ck-header="copy small">12.7 Interpretation</h4>
    <p ck-text="">The titles and annotations, including the "Summary" sections, contained in these terms are inserted only as a matter of convenience and have no legal or contractual effect. The Agreement will not be construed against Credit Karma because we drafted it.</p>
