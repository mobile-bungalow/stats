            Service</a> and other terms and policies referenced here, will govern your use of
            Google+ Pages (Google+ Pages Terms). Please check from time to time for updates. Your

            Authority and Access
          </h2>
          <p>
            Subject to the Google+ Pages Terms, any Google+ user may create a Google+ Page, but
            only users with authority over the subject matter may own and/or manage the Google+
            Page. You may not share login credentials for your Page. You and Google may authorize
            users who have authority over the subject matter to act as managers or to become an
            owner of your Page. Any such user must accept these Additional Terms before becoming a
            manager or owner. If you transfer ownership of your Page you will no longer be able to
            take certain actions on the Page (for example, deleting a Page). Please see the Google+
            Help Center for additional information on multiple managers, multiple owners and
            transferring ownership of your Google+ Page.

            the Google+ Pages Terms. As with Google+ profiles, your Google+ Page is public to the
            world. Google+ Pages are a type of Google+ profile, and each Google+ Page created has a
            separate Google Account associated with it. You may select appropriate restrictions
            (e.g. age categories) in the Google+ Pages user interface to limit interaction with
            your Google+ Pages by signed-in Google+ users. Google reserves the right to restrict
            the content on your Google+ Page at its discretion. Except as otherwise required by the
            Google+ Pages Terms, you may not include terms, conditions or non-Google provided
            technical restrictions on Google+ Pages.
