Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our&nbsp;</span><a href="/arbitration"><span>Arbitration Procedures</span></a><span>.</span></li><li><span>The Jurisdiction and Venue provisions in Sections 17 and 18 are incorporated and are applicable to this Arbitration Agreement. &nbsp;</span><p><span>As you decide whether to agree to this Arbitration Agreement, here are some important considerations:</span></p><ul><li><span>Arbitration is a process of private dispute resolution that does not involve the civil courts, a civil judge or a jury. Instead, the parties dispute is decided by a private arbitrator selected by the parties under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration does not limit or affect the legal claims you as an individual may bring against Tinder. Agreeing to arbitration will only affect where those claims may be brought and how they will be resolved. </span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Arbitration is generally considered to be a more rapid dispute resolution process than the judicial system, but that is not always the case. The Arbitrator will typically determine whether Tinder or you will be required to pay or split the cost of any arbitration with Tinder, based on the circumstances presented.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>IMPORTANT: THERE ARE NOW, AND MAY BE IN THE FUTURE, LAWSUITS AGAINST TINDER ALLEGING CLASS AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLASS ACTIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION 16, WHICH IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN SOME MONETARY OR OTHER RECOVERY TO YOU, IF YOU ELECT TO OPT OUT OF THE RETROACTIVE APPLICATION OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. </span><span>THE MERE EXISTENCE OF SUCH CLASS AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUITS, HOWEVER, DOES NOT MEAN THAT SUCH LAWSUITS WILL ULTIMATELY SUCCEED, OR, EVEN IF SUCCESSFUL, THAT YOU WOULD BE ENTITLED TO ANY RECOVERY.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>You will be precluded from bringing any class or representative action against Tinder, unless you timely opt out of the retroactive application of this Arbitration Agreement, and you will also be precluded from participating in any recovery resulting from any class or representative action brought against Tinder, in each case provided you are not already bound by an arbitration agreement and class action waiver previously agreed to with Tinder.</span></li></ul><p><span>WHETHER TO AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS AN IMPORTANT DECISION. IT IS YOUR DECISION TO MAKE, AND YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE TO CONDUCT FURTHER RESEARCH AND TO CONSULT WITH OTHERS  INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO AN ATTORNEY  REGARDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR DECISION, JUST AS YOU WOULD WHEN MAKING ANY OTHER IMPORTANT BUSINESS OR LIFE DECISION.</span></p><p><strong>Existing Users Limited One-Time Right To Opt Out Of The Retroactive Application of the Arbitration Agreement</strong></p><p><strong>NOTE: THIS OPT OUT SECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO NEW USERS (E.G., USERS WHO CREATE AN ACCOUNT AFTER May 8, 2018) OR EXISTING USERS WHO MAKE A PURCHASE AFTER May 8, 2018 OR ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES ARISING AFTER May 8, 2018. </strong></p><p><span>IF YOU ARE AN EXISTING USER OF TINDER, AND IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE SUBJECT TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON A RETROACTIVE BASIS, YOU MUST OPT OUT OF THE RETROACTIVE APPLICATION OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT </span><strong>WITHIN THE NEXT 30 DAYS,</strong><span> IN THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIED MANNER:</span></p><p><span>By sending an e-mail to tinderoptout@match.com within the next 30 days.
