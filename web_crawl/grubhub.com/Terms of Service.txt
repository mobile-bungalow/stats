You may order food through the Sites to be delivered from particular restaurants or other purveyors of food in cities throughout the United States and other territories where Grubhub provides such services.</p><p>Grubhub is not a restaurant or food preparation entity. The restaurants and other food purveyors available on our Sites (collectively, the “restaurants”) operate independently of Grubhub. The restaurants are required to comply with federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, and standards pertaining to the preparation, sale, and marketing of food, including, without limitation, food preparation and safety and menu disclosure. Grubhub is not liable or responsible for the restaurants' food preparation or safety and does not verify their compliance with all applicable laws. In addition, Grubhub does not guarantee the quality of what the restaurants or other food purveyors sell, nor does it guarantee the services provided by them, including, without limitation, in those cases where they provide the delivery services or engage another third party delivery service. Grubhub does not independently verify, and is not liable for, representations made by restaurants regarding their food, including, without limitation, any menu- or restaurant-level descriptors or disclosures. Some deliveries are provided by Grubhub's network of independent delivery service providers (“DSPs”). DSPs have entered into agreements with Grubhub, which require them to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, traffic laws, requirements of the applicable Department of Motor Vehicles, and applicable insurance requirements. Grubhub shall not be liable or responsible for any delivery services provided by DSPs or any subcontractors of DSPs, or any errors or misrepresentations made by any of them.</p><h2 id="using-grubhub">USING GRUBHUB</h2><p>You may only create and hold one account on each Site for your personal use (an “Account”).

In consideration of the use of the Sites and the services contained therein, you agree that you are able to create a binding legal obligation with Grubhub, and you also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, and (b) maintain and promptly update the personal information you provide to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.</p><p>The Sites may permit you to make purchases without an Account or without logging in to your Account. If you make a purchase in this manner, we may create an Account for you based on the information provide to us in connection with the transaction (e.g., your name, phone number, email address, and other transaction information). If you are a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside (generally under the age of 18), you must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, your parent or legal guardian to use the Sites, and your parent or legal guardian must read and agree to this Agreement prior to your using the Sites. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are not authorized to use the Sites if you are under the age of 13. If you are using the Sites on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to this Agreement and you agree to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of that organization.</p><p>If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, including, without limitation, having an invalid or expired payment method on file, or if Grubhub has reasonable grounds to suspect that any information you provide is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Grubhub has the right to block your current or future use of the Sites (or any portion thereof) and/or terminate this Agreement with you. If your Account is cancelled for any or no reason, you may forfeit any pending, current, or future account credits or promotional offers and any other forms of unredeemed value in or associated with your Account without prior notice to you.</p><p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account including your password and, if applicable, any password for Facebook, Google, or other third party login.

In such jurisdictions, if you place an order that includes any alcoholic beverage, you represent and warrant that you are at least 21 years of age. Upon delivery or pickup, as applicable, you shall present a government-issued identification card, evidencing your age, consistent with applicable legal requirements. If you do not comply with these terms, you agree that the alcoholic beverage(s) will not be released to you, and you may forfeit the cost of such beverages.</p><h2 id="payment-and-our-credit-policy">PAYMENT AND OUR CREDIT POLICY</h2><p>Certain features of the Sites, including, without limitation, the placing of orders, may require you to make certain payments. When paid by you, these payments are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Grubhub. Grubhub, in its sole discretion, may offer credits or refunds on a case-by-case basis including, by way of example, in the event of an error with your order or in the amounts you were charged.</p><p>Grubhub will charge, and you authorize Grubhub to charge, the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. If you pay any amounts with a credit card, Grubhub may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has credit available for your intended purchase. In the event Grubhub advances payment for any of your orders placed via the Sites (e.g., if you sign up for a corporate account), Grubhub may separately send you invoices for payment of those advanced amounts. In the event that you fail to pay such invoices within thirty (30) days of the date of such invoice (the “Payment Due Date”), you grant Grubhub the right, but not the obligation, to charge the credit card you provide with your Account at any time after any Payment Due Date, unless prohibited by law.</p><p>Grubhub reserves the right to establish, remove, and/or revise prices, fees, and/or surcharges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the services at any time. Grubhub may also, in its sole discretion, make promotional offers with different features and different rates to any or all of our customers. Unless made to you, these promotional offers will have no bearing on your obligation to pay the amounts charged.</p><p>The provider of services is set forth herein.

To unsubscribe from Customer Care messages, just reply to the message by texting “STOP” to the number sending the message.</p><p>If you unsubscribe from receiving text messages from Grubhub through the process described above, you may continue to receive text messages for a short period while Grubhub processes your request(s).
