This is the entire agreement between the parties relating to the matters contained herein.&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>20. &amp;nbsp;ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE: &amp;nbsp;As a Registered Accountholder, your use of the Services may enable you to enter into agreements and/or to make purchases electronically. &amp;nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that your electronic submissions constitute your agreement and intent to be bound by any such agreements and/or purchases, including without limitation all transactions you enter into in connection with the Service. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>21. &amp;nbsp;FORCE MAJEURE: &amp;nbsp;HBO shall not have any liability to you by reason of any delay or failure to perform any obligation hereunder if the delay or failure to perform is occasioned by force majeure, which shall refer to any act of God, storm, fire, casualty, unanticipated work stoppage, power outage, satellite failure, strike, lockout, labor dispute, civil disturbance, riot, war, national emergency, Governmental action, or other cause beyond its control. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>22. &amp;nbsp;DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION AND NO CLASS RELIEF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(a) Except with regard to the enforceability of the arbitration agreement contained herein, which shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (as set forth below in subsection 22(d) below), this Agreement shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, as they are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within New York and without regard to conflict of law principles. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) Except in relation to intellectual property rights as set forth in subparagraph (e) below, we each agree to resolve disputes through binding arbitration with no class relief instead of in courts. &amp;nbsp;Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. &amp;nbsp;Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. &amp;nbsp;Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Service or your use of the Service, including the website, user interface, these Terms and this Arbitration Agreement, and the HBO Privacy Policy, must be filed within one year of the relevant events. &amp;nbsp;You waive - that is, give up your right to pursue - any dispute, claim or controversy that is not filed within one year and any right you may have had to pursue that dispute, claim or controversy in any forum is permanently barred. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(d) Except as set forth in subparagraph (e) below, HBO and you agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Service or your use of the Service, including the website, user interface, these Terms and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined on an individual basis, without class relief, by binding arbitration instead of courts of general jurisdiction. &amp;nbsp;This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. &amp;nbsp;It includes, but is not limited to:&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(i) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(ii) claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iii) claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>References in this paragraph to &amp;quot;HBO,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;you,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;us&amp;quot; include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, licensees, licensors or providers of content, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users of the Service under this or prior Agreements. &amp;nbsp;This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. &amp;nbsp;Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and HBO are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. &amp;nbsp;This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. &amp;nbsp;This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by other mail delivery service that provides proof of delivery (e.g., FedEx), a written notice of dispute (&amp;quot;Notice&amp;quot;). &amp;nbsp;The Notice to HBO should be addressed to: General Counsel, Home Box Office, Inc., 1100 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036 (&amp;quot;Notice Address&amp;quot;). &amp;nbsp;The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (&amp;quot;Demand&amp;quot;). &amp;nbsp;If HBO and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 60 days after the Notice is received, you or HBO may commence an arbitration proceeding. &amp;nbsp;During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by HBO or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or HBO is entitled. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your claim is for less than $75,000, upon written request to the Notice Address prior to commencement of the arbitration, HBO will advance the arbitration filing fee and arbitrator's costs by direct payment to the appropriate entity. &amp;nbsp;If the arbitration proceeding is decided in HBO's favor, you shall reimburse HBO for the fees and costs advanced to the extent available in a judicial proceeding. &amp;nbsp;If the arbitration is decided in your favor - which occurs if there is an award to you that is greater than the value of HBO's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected - you will not be required to reimburse HBO for any of the fees and costs advanced. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, &amp;quot;AAA Rules&amp;quot;) of the American Arbitration Association (&amp;quot;AAA&amp;quot;), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. &amp;nbsp;The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. &amp;nbsp;The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement, including Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. &amp;nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the right to award money damages and other appropriate relief, consistent with the terms of this agreement; HOWEVER THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO AWARD INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST EITHER PARTY OR TO CERTIFY A CLASS ACTION OF ANY KIND. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide. &amp;nbsp;Unless HBO and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place either (i) in person in the county (or parish) of the billing address associated with your subscription according to your Distributor, whose records shall be the sole determinant, or in New York, New York, at your option, or (ii) by video conference during which you shall be able to appear from the county (or parish) of the billing address associated with your subscription according to your Distributor, whose records shall be the sole determinant, or any other location of your choosing which has appropriate video conference facilities available. &amp;nbsp;If your claim is for $10,000 or less, there shall be no in person hearing; and we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by video conference as established by the AAA Rules. &amp;nbsp;If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to and format of a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. &amp;nbsp;Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each party shall be responsible for their own attorneys' fees. &amp;nbsp;Although under some laws HBO may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, HBO agrees that it will seek such an award only in the event that the substance of your claim or the relief sought has been deemed by the arbitrator to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YOU AND HBO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. &amp;nbsp;Further, unless both you and HBO agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes enforcing, protecting, or concerning the validity of any of your or HBO's intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of HBO's licensors) are not covered by this agreement to arbitrate contained in paragraph 22. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(f) If the waiver of the right to participate in a class action set forth in subparagraphs (b) and (d) above is found to be illegal or unenforceable for any reason whether by judicial, legislative, or other action, than the entirety of the agreement to arbitrate contained in paragraphs (b) and (d) is null and void. &amp;nbsp;In that instance, you and HBO agree to waive your right to a jury trial. &amp;nbsp;You and HBO further agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Service or your use of the Service, including the website, user interface, and these Terms of Use shall be brought in the appropriate state or federal court located in New York County, New York; and that we both irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in New York County, New York. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>23. EXPORT CONTROL: You may not use or otherwise export or re-export any software associated with the Service except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the software was obtained. &amp;nbsp;In particular, but without limitation, the software may not be exported or re-exported into any U.S. embargoed countries or to any persons listed as prohibited under applicable law or regulation. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>24. MISCELLANEOUS: &amp;nbsp;These Terms cannot be changed or terminated orally. &amp;nbsp;Any failure of HBO to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. &amp;nbsp;No waiver by HBO of any provision of these Terms will be of any force or effect unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of HBO. &amp;nbsp;HBO may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice. &amp;nbsp;These Terms may not be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior written consent of an officer of HBO. &amp;nbsp;If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, then the provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. &amp;nbsp;The section titles in this Agreement are inserted only as a matter of convenience and have no legal or contractual effect. &amp;nbsp;You agree that these Terms will not be construed against HBO by virtue of HBO having drafted them. &amp;nbsp;HBO reserves the right to deny access to all or part of the Service to you or any person in its sole discretion without notice or liability of any kind. &amp;nbsp;Any violation of these Terms may be referred to law enforcement authorities. &amp;nbsp;These Terms constitute the entire understanding and agreement between you and HBO and supersede any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Service and your use of the Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>25. &amp;nbsp;CLOSED CAPTIONING: &amp;nbsp;If you have specific concerns or inquiries regarding closed captioning, please contact:&amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosa Oh<br>\r\n\r\nHBO Media Relations&amp;nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n1100 Avenue of the Americas, 10th Floor&amp;nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\nNew York, NY 10036&amp;nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\nE-Mail: &amp;nbsp;hboclosedcaptions@hbo.com<br>\r\n\r\nPhone: 212-512-1208<br>\r\n\r\nFax: 212-512-5637</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY ALL OF THE FOREGOING TERMS PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS AND/OR USE THE SERVICE. &amp;nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last updated: &amp;nbsp;July 1, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n&quot;},&quot;band&quot;:&quot;Text&quot;}"><div class="cf w-100 components/Band--band" data-bi-context="{&quot;band&quot;:&quot;Text&quot;}"><div class="components/Band--maxWidth"><div class="modules/Article--externalHtmlContainer modules/Article--heavyHeader modules/Article--articleContent"><p>IMPORTANT!

<p>9. SUBMISSIONS AND POSTINGS: </p>

<p>17. USE IN U.S. ONLY: This Service is intended for viewing solely in the U.S.  HBO makes no representation that materials or other content in the Service are appropriate or available for use outside the U.S. If you choose to access the Service from other locations you do so on your own initiative and at your own risk. You are responsible for complying with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. You specifically agree to comply with all applicable laws concerning the transmission of technical data exported from the U.S. or the country you reside in.</p>

<p>18. INDEMNITY: You agree to indemnify and hold harmless HBO, its directors, officers, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, and licensors, from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys" fees, resulting from your breach of any of the foregoing provisions, representations or warranties, and/or from your placement or transmission of any content onto the Service's servers, and/or from any and all use of your account in violation of this Agreement or the failure to fulfill any obligations relating to your account incurred by you or any other person using your account. We reserve the right to take over the exclusive defense of any claim for which we are entitled to indemnification under this Section.

<p>20.  ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE:  As a Registered Accountholder, your use of the Services may enable you to enter into agreements and/or to make purchases electronically.

<p>21.  FORCE MAJEURE:  HBO shall not have any liability to you by reason of any delay or failure to perform any obligation hereunder if the delay or failure to perform is occasioned by force majeure, which shall refer to any act of God, storm, fire, casualty, unanticipated work stoppage, power outage, satellite failure, strike, lockout, labor dispute, civil disturbance, riot, war, national emergency, Governmental action, or other cause beyond its control.  </p>

<p>22.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION AND NO CLASS RELIEF</p>

<p>(a) Except with regard to the enforceability of the arbitration agreement contained herein, which shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (as set forth below in subsection 22(d) below), this Agreement shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, as they are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within New York and without regard to conflict of law principles.  </p>

<p>(b) Except in relation to intellectual property rights as set forth in subparagraph (e) below, we each agree to resolve disputes through binding arbitration with no class relief instead of in courts.  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.  Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.  </p>

<p>(c) Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Service or your use of the Service, including the website, user interface, these Terms and this Arbitration Agreement, and the HBO Privacy Policy, must be filed within one year of the relevant events.  You waive - that is, give up your right to pursue - any dispute, claim or controversy that is not filed within one year and any right you may have had to pursue that dispute, claim or controversy in any forum is permanently barred.  </p>

<p>(d) Except as set forth in subparagraph (e) below, HBO and you agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Service or your use of the Service, including the website, user interface, these Terms and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined on an individual basis, without class relief, by binding arbitration instead of courts of general jurisdiction.  This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.  It includes, but is not limited to: </p>

<p>(i) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</p>

<p>(ii) claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement;</p>

<p>(iii) claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p>References in this paragraph to "HBO," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, licensees, licensors or providers of content, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users of the Service under this or prior Agreements.  This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.  Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.  </p>

<p>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and HBO are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.  </p>

<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by other mail delivery service that provides proof of delivery (e.g., FedEx), a written notice of dispute ("Notice").  The Notice to HBO should be addressed to: General Counsel, Home Box Office, Inc., 1100 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036 ("Notice Address").  The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").  If HBO and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 60 days after the Notice is received, you or HBO may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by HBO or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or HBO is entitled.  </p>

<p>If your claim is for less than $75,000, upon written request to the Notice Address prior to commencement of the arbitration, HBO will advance the arbitration filing fee and arbitrator's costs by direct payment to the appropriate entity.  If the arbitration proceeding is decided in HBO's favor, you shall reimburse HBO for the fees and costs advanced to the extent available in a judicial proceeding.  If the arbitration is decided in your favor - which occurs if there is an award to you that is greater than the value of HBO's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected - you will not be required to reimburse HBO for any of the fees and costs advanced.  </p>

<p>The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement, including Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.  The arbitrator shall have the right to award money damages and other appropriate relief, consistent with the terms of this agreement; HOWEVER THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO AWARD INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST EITHER PARTY OR TO CERTIFY A CLASS ACTION OF ANY KIND.  </p>

<p>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide.  Unless HBO and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place either (i) in person in the county (or parish) of the billing address associated with your subscription according to your Distributor, whose records shall be the sole determinant, or in New York, New York, at your option, or (ii) by video conference during which you shall be able to appear from the county (or parish) of the billing address associated with your subscription according to your Distributor, whose records shall be the sole determinant, or any other location of your choosing which has appropriate video conference facilities available.  If your claim is for $10,000 or less, there shall be no in person hearing; and we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by video conference as established by the AAA Rules.  If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to and format of a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  </p>

<p>Each party shall be responsible for their own attorneys' fees.  Although under some laws HBO may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, HBO agrees that it will seek such an award only in the event that the substance of your claim or the relief sought has been deemed by the arbitrator to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).  </p>

<p>YOU AND HBO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further, unless both you and HBO agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  </p>

<p>(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes enforcing, protecting, or concerning the validity of any of your or HBO's intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of HBO's licensors) are not covered by this agreement to arbitrate contained in paragraph 22.  </p>

<p>(f) If the waiver of the right to participate in a class action set forth in subparagraphs (b) and (d) above is found to be illegal or unenforceable for any reason whether by judicial, legislative, or other action, than the entirety of the agreement to arbitrate contained in paragraphs (b) and (d) is null and void.  In that instance, you and HBO agree to waive your right to a jury trial.  You and HBO further agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Service or your use of the Service, including the website, user interface, and these Terms of Use shall be brought in the appropriate state or federal court located in New York County, New York; and that we both irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in New York County, New York.   </p>

<p>23. EXPORT CONTROL: You may not use or otherwise export or re-export any software associated with the Service except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the software was obtained.  In particular, but without limitation, the software may not be exported or re-exported into any U.S. embargoed countries or to any persons listed as prohibited under applicable law or regulation.  </p>

<p>24. MISCELLANEOUS:  These Terms cannot be changed or terminated orally.  Any failure of HBO to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  No waiver by HBO of any provision of these Terms will be of any force or effect unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of HBO.  HBO may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice.  These Terms may not be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior written consent of an officer of HBO.  If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, then the provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  The section titles in this Agreement are inserted only as a matter of convenience and have no legal or contractual effect.  You agree that these Terms will not be construed against HBO by virtue of HBO having drafted them.  HBO reserves the right to deny access to all or part of the Service to you or any person in its sole discretion without notice or liability of any kind.  Any violation of these Terms may be referred to law enforcement authorities.  These Terms constitute the entire understanding and agreement between you and HBO and supersede any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Service and your use of the Service.</p>
