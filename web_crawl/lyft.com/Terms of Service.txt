                <h1>Lyft Terms of Service</h1>
                <p>Last Updated: February 6, 2018</p>
                <p>
                    These terms of service constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”)
                    between you and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft,” “we,” “us” or “our”) governing your use of the
                    Lyft application, website, and technology platform (collectively, the “Lyft
                    Platform”).
                </p>
                <p class="uppercase">
                    Please be advised: This Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims you
                    and Lyft have against each other can be brought
                    (<a href="#tos-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration-agreement">see Section 17 below</a>).
                    These provisions will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you
                    have against Lyft to binding and final arbitration on an individual basis, not as a
                    plaintiff or class member in any class, group or representative action or
                    proceeding. As a Driver or Driver applicant, you have an opportunity to opt out of
                    arbitration with respect to certain claims as provided in Section 17.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By entering into to this Agreement, and/or by using or accessing the Lyft platform
                    you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement (including the dispute
                    resolution and arbitration provisions in Section 17) and accept all of its terms.
                    <span class="uppercase">If you do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions
                    of this Agreement, you may not use or access the Lyft Platform.</span> If you use
                    the services of Lyft or its affiliates in another country, by using the Lyft
                    Platform in that country you agree to be subject to Lyft’s terms of service for
                    that country.

                <h2>The Lyft Platform</h2>
                <p>
                    The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where persons who seek transportation to
                    certain destinations (“Riders”) can be matched with persons driving to or through
                    those destinations (“Drivers”).  Drivers and Riders are collectively referred to
                    herein as “Users,” and each User shall create a User account that enables access to
                    the Lyft Platform. Each person may only create one User account, and Lyft reserves
                    the right to shut down any additional accounts. As a User, you authorize Lyft to
                    match you with a Driver or Rider based on factors such as your location, the
                    estimated time to pickup, your destination, user preferences, and platform
                    efficiency, and to cancel an existing match and rematch based on the same
                    considerations. For purposes of this Agreement, the driving services provided by
                    Drivers to Riders that are matched through the Platform shall be referred to
                    collectively as the “Services”.   Any decision by a User to offer or accept
                    Services is a decision made in such User’s sole discretion. Each transportation
                    Service provided by a Driver to a Rider shall constitute a separate agreement
                    between such persons.

                <h2>Modification to the Agreement</h2>
                <p>
                    In the event Lyft modifies the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
                    modifications shall be binding on you only upon your acceptance of the modified
                    Agreement. Lyft reserves the right to modify any information referenced in the
                    hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall
                    become effective upon posting. Continued use of the Lyft Platform or Services after
                    any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. Unless material
                    changes are made to the arbitration provisions herein, you agree that modification
                    of this Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration
                    (if applicable).

                <h2>Eligibility</h2>
                <p>
                    The Lyft Platform may only be used by individuals who can form legally binding
                    contracts under applicable law. The Lyft Platform is not available to children
                    (persons under the age of 18) or Users who have had their User account temporarily
                    or permanently deactivated. By becoming a User, you represent and warrant that you
                    are at least 18 years old and that you have the right, authority and capacity to
                    enter into and abide by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You may not
                    allow other persons to use your User account, and you agree that you are the sole
                    authorized user of your account.

                <h2>Charges</h2>
                <p>
                    As a Rider, you understand that request or use of the Services may result in
                    charges to you (“Charges”). Charges include Fares and other applicable fees, tolls,
                    surcharges, and taxes as set forth on your market’s Lyft Cities page (<a href="https://www.lyft.com/cities">www.lyft.com/cities</a>), plus any tips to the
                    Driver that you elect to pay. Lyft has the authority and reserves the right to
                    determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms to your market’s
                    Lyft Cities page or quoting you a price for a specific ride at the time you make a
                    request. Pricing may vary based on the type of service you request (e.g., Lyft
                    Plus, Lyft SUV) as described on your market’s Lyft Cities page. You are responsible
                    for reviewing the applicable Lyft Cities page or price quote within the Lyft app
                    and shall be responsible for all Charges incurred under your User account
                    regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fares. There are two types of fares, variable and quoted.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Variable Fares</strong>. Variable fares consist of a base charge and
                        incremental charges based on the duration and distance of your ride. For
                        particularly short rides, minimum fares may apply. Please note that we use GPS
                        data from your Driver’s phone to calculate the distance traveled on your ride.
                        We cannot guarantee the availability or accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal
                        we will calculate time and distance using available data from your ride.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Quoted Fares</strong>. In some cases Lyft may quote you a Fare at the
                        time of your request. The quote is subject to change until the ride request is
                        confirmed. If during your ride you change your destination, make multiple
                        stops, or attempt to abuse the Lyft Platform, we may cancel the fare quote and
                        charge you a variable fare based on the time and distance of your ride. Lyft
                        does not guarantee that the quoted fare price will be equal to a variable fare
                        for the same ride.

                </ul>

                    Fees and Other Charges.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Service Fee</strong>. You may be charged a “Service Fee” for each ride
                        as set forth on the applicable Lyft Cities page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prime Time</strong>. At times of high demand for Services (“Prime
                        Time”) you acknowledge that Charges may increase substantially. For all rides
                        with a variable fare, we will use reasonable efforts to inform you of any Prime
                        Time multipliers in effect at the time of your request. For quoted fares we may
                        factor in the Prime Time multiplier into the quoted price of the ride.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cancellation Fee</strong>. After requesting a ride you may cancel it
                        through the app, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee may apply.
                        You may also be charged if you fail to show up after requesting a ride. Please
                        check out our Help Center to learn more about
                        <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012922687-Cancellation-policy-for-passengers">

                    <li>
                        <strong>Damage Fee</strong>. If a Driver reports that you have materially
                        damaged the Driver's vehicle, you agree to pay a “Damage Fee” of up to $250
                        depending on the extent of the damage (as determined by Lyft in its sole
                        discretion), towards vehicle repair or cleaning. Lyft reserves the right (but
                        is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior
                        to processing the Damage Fee.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tolls</strong>. In some instances tolls (or return tolls) may apply to
                        your ride. Please see our Help Center and your market’s Lyft Cities page for
                        more <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012927787-Toll-info-for-passengers">

                        and return charges</a>. We do not guarantee that the amount charged by Lyft
                        will match the toll charged to the Driver, if any.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Other Charges</strong>. Other fee and surcharges may apply to your
                        ride, including: actual or anticipated airport fees, state or local fees, event
                        fees as determined by Lyft or its marketing partners, and processing fees for
                        split payments. In addition, where required by law Lyft will collect applicable
                        taxes. See your market’s Lyft Cities page for details on other
                        Charges that may apply to your ride.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Tips</strong>. Following a ride, you may elect to tip your Driver in
                        cash or through the Lyft application. Any tips will be provided entirely to the
                        applicable Driver.

                    General.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Facilitation of Charges</strong>. All Charges are facilitated through a
                        third-party payment processing service (e.g., Stripe, Inc., or Braintree, a
                        division of PayPal, Inc.). Lyft may replace its third-party payment processing
                        services without notice to you. Charges shall only be made through the Lyft
                        Platform. With the exception of tips, cash payments are strictly prohibited.
                        Your payment of Charges to Lyft satisfies your payment obligation for your use
                        of the Lyft Platform and Services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Refunds</strong>. All Charges are non-refundable. This no-refund
                        policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage
                        of the Lyft Platform, any disruption to the Lyft Platform or Services, or any
                        other reason whatsoever.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Coupons</strong>. You may receive coupons that you can apply toward
                        payment of certain Charges upon completion of a Ride. Coupons are only valid
                        for use on the Lyft Platform, and are not transferable or redeemable for cash
                        except as required by law.  Coupons cannot be combined, and if the cost of your
                        ride exceeds the applicable credit or discount value we will charge your
                        payment method on file for the outstanding cost of the Ride. For quoted or
                        variable fares, Lyft may deduct the amount attributable to the Service Fee,
                        Tolls, or Other Charges before application of the coupon.  If you split payment
                        for a Ride with another User, your coupon will only apply to your portion of
                        the Charges.  Additional restrictions on coupons may apply as communicated to
                        you in a relevant promotion or by clicking on the relevant coupon within the
                        Promotions section of the Lyft App.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Credit Card Authorization</strong>. Upon addition of a new payment
                        method or each ride request, Lyft may seek authorization of your selected
                        payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the ride cost will be
                        covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a
                        charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization
                        amount until your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our
                        authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be
                        subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or prepaid
                        card. We cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist
                        you in recovering them from your issuing bank. Check out our Help Center to

                    Drivers (“Referred Drivers”) in your country. Lyft Codes may only be distributed
                    for promotional purposes and must be given away free of charge. You may not sell,
                    trade, or barter your Lyft Code. You are prohibited from advertising Lyft Codes in
                    any way, including through any of the following: Google, Facebook, Twitter, Bing

                    family to become new Users of the Lyft Platform in your country (the “Referral

                    Lyft does not provide transportation services, and Lyft is not a transportation
                    carrier. Lyft is not a common carrier or public carrier. It is up to the Driver to
                    decide whether or not to offer a ride to a Rider contacted through the Lyft
                    Platform, and it is up to the Rider to decide whether or not to accept a ride from
                    any Driver contacted through the Lyft Platform. We cannot ensure that a Driver or
                    Rider will complete an arranged transportation service. We have no control over the
                    quality or safety of the transportation that occurs as a result of the Services.

                <p>
                    <span class="uppercase">You and Lyft mutually agree to waive our respective
                    rights to resolution of disputes in a court of law by a judge or jury and agree
                    to resolve any dispute by arbitration,</span> as set forth below. This
                    agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) is governed by the Federal
                    Arbitration Act and survives after the Agreement terminates or your
                    relationship with Lyft ends. <span class="uppercase">Any arbitration under this
                    Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class
                    actions are not permitted.</span> Except as expressly provided below, this
                    Arbitration Agreement applies to all Claims (defined below) between you and
                    Lyft, including our affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, successors and assigns,
                    and each of our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, or
                    shareholders. This Arbitration Agreement also applies to claims between you and
                    Lyft’s service providers, including but not limited to background check providers
                    and payment processors; and such service providers shall be considered intended
                    third party beneficiaries of this Arbitration Agreement.

                <p>
                    Except as expressly provided below, <span class="uppercase">all disputes and claims
                    between us (each a “Claim” and collectively, “Claims”) shall be exclusively
                    resolved by binding arbitration solely between you and Lyft.</span> These Claims
                    include, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy, whether based
                    on past, present, or future events, arising out of or relating to: this Agreement
                    and prior versions thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement,
                    interpretation or validity thereof), the Lyft Platform, the Services, any other
                    goods or services made available through the Lyft Platform, your relationship with
                    Lyft, the threatened or actual suspension, deactivation or termination of your User

                    or offers made by Lyft, any city, county, state or federal wage-hour law, trade
                    secrets, unfair competition, compensation, breaks and rest periods, expense
                    reimbursement, wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation,

                    Medical Leave Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Employee Retirement Income Security
                    Act (except for individual claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan
                    sponsored by Lyft and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
                    1974 or funded by insurance), and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or
                    similar subject matters, and all other federal and state statutory and common law
                    claims. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a Claim (including disputes
                    about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the
                    Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly
                    provided
                    below.

                <p>
                    <span class="uppercase">By agreeing to arbitration, you understand that you and
                    Lyft are waiving the right to sue in court or have a jury trial for all Claims,
                    except as expressly otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.</span>
                    This Arbitration Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every claim or
                    dispute that can lawfully be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes
                    which by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement are expressly excluded from
                    the requirement to arbitrate.

                    (b) Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.
                </h5>

                <p class="uppercase">
                    You understand and agree that you and Lyft may each bring Claims in arbitration
                    against the other only in an individual capacity and not on a class, collective
                    action, or representative basis (“Class Action Waiver”).  You understand and
                    agree that you and Lyft both are waiving the right to pursue or have a dispute
                    resolved as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective or
                    representative proceeding.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this subsection (b)
                    shall not apply to representative private attorneys general act claims brought
                    against Lyft, which are addressed separately in Section 17(c).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue
                    any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have
                    no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on a class,
                    collective, or representative basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
                    injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to
                    the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or
                    the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability,
                    revocability or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil
                    court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (1)
                    the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there
                    is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as
                    to any Claims, then those Claims shall be severed from any remaining claims and may
                    be brought in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver
                    shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims to
                    the fullest extent possible.

                <h5>
                    (c) Representative PAGA Waiver.
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration
                    Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and Lyft agree not
                    to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private
                    Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq.,
                    in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private
                    attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Lyft
                    agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual
                    basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or
                    subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to
                    resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective
                    proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or
                    subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “representative PAGA Waiver”).
                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration
                    Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability,
                    enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may
                    be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an
                    arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be
                    unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall
                    be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision
                    shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement
                    that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the
                    Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other
                    representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a
                    civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent
                    that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent
                    jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that
                    the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims,
                    the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the
                    outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.

                    (d) Rules Governing the Arbitration.
                </h5>

                <p>
                    Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be
                    administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its
                    <a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules/searchrules/rulesdetail?_afrWindowId=57rsw71ei_1&amp;_afrLoop=1335893675945842&amp;doc=ADRSTAGE2021424&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_adf.ctrl-state=hf27f5iaa_4#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3D57rsw71ei_1%26_afrLoop%3D1335893675945842%26doc%3DADRSTAGE2021424%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3D57rsw71ei_79">
                    Consumer Arbitration Rules</a> that are in effect at the time the arbitration
                    is initiated, as modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement. Copies of
                    these rules can be obtained at the AAA’s website (www.adr.org) (the “AAA
                    Rules”) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                    if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the
                    Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a
                    different set of AAA Rules, but in no event shall the arbitrator consolidate
                    more than one person’s Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of
                    representative, collective, or class proceeding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of the arbitration, both you and Lyft will have the opportunity for
                    reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the
                    Claim. The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be
                    available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief
                    only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
                    necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims. The
                    arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s
                    decision which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions
                    on which the decision is based.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with
                    applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The
                    arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving
                    different Riders or Drivers, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations
                    involving the same Rider or Driver to the extent required by applicable law.
                    The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award
                    rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
                    thereof, provided that any award may be challenged in a court of competent
                    jurisdiction.

                </h5>

                <p>
                    The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant AAA
                    Rules subject to the following modifications:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If you initiate arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement after
                        participating in the optional Negotiation process described in subsection
                        (k) below and are otherwise required to pay a filing fee under the relevant
                        AAA Rules, Lyft agrees that, unless your claim is for $5,000 or more, your
                        share of the filing and arbitration fees is limited to $50, and that, after
                        you submit proof of payment of the filing fee to Lyft, Lyft will promptly
                        reimburse you for all but $50 of the filing fee. If, however, the
                        arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief
                        sought in the claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as
                        measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
                        11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA
                        Rules.

                    <li>
                        If Lyft initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, Lyft will

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With respect to any Claims brought by Lyft against a Driver, or for Claims
                        brought by a Driver against Lyft that: (A) are based on an alleged employment
                        relationship between Lyft and a Driver; (B) arise out of, or relate to, Lyft’s
                        actual deactivation of a Driver’s User account or a threat by Lyft to
                        deactivate a Driver’s User account; (C) arise out of, or relate to, Lyft’s
                        actual termination of a Driver’s Agreement with Lyft under the termination
                        provisions of this Agreement, or a threat by Lyft to terminate a Driver’s
                        Agreement; (D) arise out of, or relate to, Fares (as defined in this Agreement,
                        including Lyft’s commission or fees on the Fares), tips, or average hourly
                        guarantees owed by Lyft to Drivers for Services, other than disputes relating
                        to referral bonuses, other Lyft promotions, or consumer-type disputes, or (E)
                        arise out of or relate to background checks performed in connection with a user
                        seeking to become a Driver (the subset of Claims in subsections (A)-(E) shall
                        be collectively referred to as “Driver Claims”), Lyft shall pay all costs
                        unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims
                        before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and
                        expenses (to the extent not paid by Lyft pursuant to the fee provisions above).
                        However, if you are the party initiating the Driver Claim, you shall be
                        responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would
                        be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state
                        in which you provide Services to Riders, unless a lower fee amount would be
                        owed by you pursuant to the AAA Rules, applicable law, or subsection (e)(1)
                        above.  Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be
                        resolved by the arbitrator. For purposes of this Section 17(e)(3), the term
                        “Driver” shall be deemed to include both Drivers and Driver applicants who have
                        not been approved to drive.

                        that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would
                        incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court such as costs to subpoena
                        witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition
                        transcripts, copy documents, etc.).

                        authorized by applicable law.

                        agrees that it will not seek such an award.

                        faith in the optional Negotiation process described in subsection (k)

                    (f) Location and Manner of Arbitration.
                </h5>

                <p>
                    Unless you and Lyft agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between Lyft and
                    a Rider will take place in the county of your billing address, and any
                    arbitration hearings between Lyft and a Driver will take place in the county in
                    which the Driver provides Services. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your
                    county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available
                    location for a AAA arbitration. If your Claim is for $10,000 or less, Lyft
                    agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on
                    the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic
                    hearing, or by an in-person hearing as determined by the AAA Rules. If your
                    Claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA
                    Rules.

                    This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of
                    claims: (1) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the
                    scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction; (2) a representative action
                    brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorneys general acts, to
                    the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 17(c) of such action is deemed
                    unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not
                    preempted by the FAA; (3) claims for workers’ compensation, state disability
                    insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; and (4) claims that may not be
                    subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law not preempted by the
                    FAA.

                    state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed
                    to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any
                    agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative
                    remedies before making a claim in arbitration  However, should you bring an
                    administrative claim, you may only seek or recover money damages of any type
                    pursuant to this Arbitration Provision, and you knowingly and voluntarily waive the
                    right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative
                    complaint, except for a complaint issued by the NLRB.  Should you participate in an
                    NLRB proceeding, you may only recover money damages if such recovery does not arise
                    from or relate to a claim previously adjudicated under this Arbitration Provision
                    or settled by you.  Similarly, you may not recover money damages under this
                    Arbitration Provision if you have already adjudicated such claim with the NLRB.
                    Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Agreement prevents your participation in
                    an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise
                    covered by this Arbitration Provision.

                    As a Driver or Driver applicant, you may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate
                    Driver Claims defined in Section 17(e)(3) (except as limited by Section 17(i)
                    above) pursuant to the terms of this subsection if you have not previously agreed
                    to an arbitration provision in Lyft’s Terms of Service where you had the
                    opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate.  If you have previously
                    agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to your
                    prior arbitration agreement made by this provision in the manner specified below,

                    In order to be effective, (A) the writing must clearly indicate your intent to

                    the date this Agreement is executed by you. Should you not opt out within the
                    30-day period, you and Lyft shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration
                    Agreement in full (including with respect to Driver Claims that are not part of
                    a Pending Settlement Action). As provided in paragraph 17(i) above, any opt out
                    that you submit shall not apply to any Driver Claims that are part of a Pending

                    Claims in which the plaintiffs seek to act on your behalf, and which, if
                    successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. But if you do agree
                    to arbitration of Driver Claims with Lyft under this Arbitration Agreement, you
                    are agreeing in advance that you will bring all such claims, and seek all
                    monetary and other relief, against Lyft in an individual arbitration provision,
                    except for the Driver Claims that are part of a Pending Settlement Action. You
                    are also agreeing in advance that you will not participate in, or seek to
                    recover monetary or other relief, for such claims in any court action or class,
                    collective, and/or representative action. You have the right to consult with
                    counsel of your choice concerning this Arbitration Agreement and you will not
                    be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to assert claims or opt-
                    out of any Driver Claims under this Arbitration Agreement.

                </h5>

                <p>
                    Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, you and Lyft may agree to
                    first attempt to negotiate any dispute, claim or controversy between the
                    parties informally for 30 days, unless this time period is mutually extended by
                    you and Lyft. A party who intends to seek negotiation under this subsection
                    must first send to the other a written notice of the dispute (“Notice”). The
                    Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2)
                    set forth the specific relief sought. All offers, promises, conduct and
                    statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by
                    any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential,
                    privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability
                    or for impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties,
                    provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not
                    be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the
                    negotiation.
