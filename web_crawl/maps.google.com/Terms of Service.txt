    <p><span>Google Maps Platform License Agreement</span></p>
    <p><span>This Google Maps Platform License Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into between Google and the entity or person agreeing to these terms ("Customer"). "Google" means either (i) Google Commerce Limited (GCL), a company incorporated under the laws of Ireland, with offices at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, if Customer has a billing address in the EU and has chosen non-business as the tax status/setting for its Google account, (ii) Google Ireland Limited, with offices at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, if Customer's billing address is in any country within Europe, the Middle East, or Africa ("EMEA"), (iii) Google Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., with offices at 70 Pasir Panjang Road, #03-71, Mapletree Business City II Singapore 117371, if Customer's billing address is in any country within the Asia Pacific region ("APAC") except as provided below for Customers with the billing address in Japan or Australia, (iv) Google Cloud Japan G.K., with offices at Roppongi Hills Mori Tower, 10-1, Roppongi 6-chome, Minato-ku Tokyo, if Customers billing address is in Japan, (v) Google Australia Pty Ltd., with offices at Level 5, 48 Pirrama Road, Pyrmont, NSW 2009 Australia, if Customers billing address is in Australia, or (vi) Google LLC, with offices at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, if Customer's billing address is in any country in the world other than those in EMEA and APAC.</span></p>
    <p><span>This Agreement is effective as of the date Customer clicks to accept the Agreement, or
      enters into a Reseller Agreement if purchasing through a Reseller (the "Effective Date").
      If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full
      legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this
      Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement. If you do not have
      the legal authority to bind Customer, please do not click to accept. This Agreement governs
      Customer's access to and use of the Services. </span></p>
    <p><span>For an offline variant of this Agreement, you may </span><span><a href="https://enterprise.google.com/maps/contact-form/">contact Google</a></span><span>&nbsp;for more information.</span></p>
    <h3 id="1-provision-of-the-services"><span>1. </span><span class="maps-underline">Provision of the Services</span><span>.</span></h3>
    <p><span>1.1 </span><span class="maps-underline">Use of the Services in Customer Applications</span><span>. &nbsp;Google will provide the Services to Customer in accordance with the applicable SLA, and Customer may use the Google Maps </span><span>Core Services</span><span>&nbsp;in Customer Application(s) in accordance with Section 3 (License).</span></p>
    <p><span>1.2 </span><span class="maps-underline">Admin Console; Projects; API Keys</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;Customer will administer the Services through the online Admin Console. To access the Services, Customer must create Project(s) and use its API key(s) in accordance with the Documentation.</span></p>
    <p><span>1.3 </span><span class="maps-underline">Accounts</span><span>. &nbsp;Customer must have an Account to access the Admin Console through which Customer may administer its use of the Services. Customer is responsible for: (a) the information it provides in connection with the Account; (b) maintaining the confidentiality and security of the Account and associated passwords; and (c) any use of its Account.</span></p>
    <p><span>1.4 </span><span class="maps-underline">Customer Domains and Applications</span><span>. Customer must list in the Admin Console each authorized domain and application that uses the Services. Customer is responsible for ensuring that only authorized domains and applications use the Services.</span></p>
    <p><span>1.5 </span><span class="maps-underline">New Features and Services</span><span>. Google may: (a) make new features or functionality available through the Services and (b) add new services to the "Services" definition (by adding them at the URL stated under that definition). Customers use of new features or functionality may be contingent on Customers agreement to additional terms applicable to the new feature or functionality.</span></p>
    <p><span>1.6 </span><span class="maps-underline">Modifications</span><span>.</span></p>
    <p><span>1.6.1 </span><span class="maps-underline">To the Services</span><span>. Google may make changes to the Services, subject to Section 9 (Deprecation Policy), which may include adding, updating, or discontinuing any Services or portion or feature(s) of the Services. Google will notify Customer of any material change to the Services.</span></p>
    <p><span>1.6.2. </span><span class="maps-underline">To the Agreement</span><span>. Google may make changes to this Agreement, including pricing (and any linked documents). Unless otherwise noted by Google, material changes to the Agreement will become effective 30 days after notice is given, except if the changes apply to new functionality in which case they will be effective immediately. Google will provide at least 90 days advance notice for materially adverse changes to any SLAs by: (a) sending an email to Customers primary point of contact; (b) posting a notice in the Admin Console; or (c) posting a notice to the applicable SLA webpage. If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, Customer should stop using the Services. Google will post any modification to this Agreement to the Terms URL.</span></p>
    <h3 id="2-payment-terms"><span>2. </span><span class="maps-underline">Payment Terms</span><span>.</span></h3>
    <p><span>2.1 </span><span class="maps-underline">Free Quota</span><span>. Certain Services are provided to Customer without charge up to the </span><span>Fee Threshold</span><span>, as applicable.</span></p>
    <p><span>2.2 </span><span class="maps-underline">Online Billing</span><span>. At the end of the applicable </span><span>Fee Accrual Period</span><span>, Google will issue an electronic bill to Customer for all charges accrued above the Fee Threshold based on (a) Customers use of the Services during the previous Fee Accrual Period; (b) any Committed Purchases selected; and (c) any Package Purchases selected. For use above the Fee Threshold, Customer will be responsible for all Fees up to the amount set in the Account and will pay all Fees in the currency set forth in the invoice. If Customer elects to pay by credit card, debit card, or other non-invoiced form of payment, Google will charge (and Customer will pay) all Fees immediately at the end of the Fee Accrual Period. If Customer elects to pay by invoice (and Google agrees), all Fees are due as stated in the invoice. Customers obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable. Google's measurement of Customers use of the Services is final. Google has no obligation to provide multiple bills. Payments made via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by Google. If Customer has entered into the Agreement with GCL, Google may collect payments via Google Payment Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales with offices at Belgrave House, 76 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9TQ, United Kingdom.</span></p>
    <p><span>2.3 </span><span class="maps-underline">Taxes</span><span>. </span></p>
    <p><span>2.3.1 Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer will pay Google for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If Google is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer, unless Customer provides Google with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. In some states the sales tax is due on the total purchase price at the time of sale and must be invoiced and collected at the time of the sale. If Customer is required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to Google, Customer must provide Google with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such withholding. If under the applicable tax legislation the Services are subject to local VAT and the Customer is required to make a withholding of local VAT from amounts payable to Google, the value of Services calculated in accordance with the above procedure will be increased (grossed up) by the Customer for the respective amount of local VAT and the grossed up amount will be regarded as a VAT inclusive price. Local VAT amount withheld from the VAT-inclusive price will be remitted to the applicable local tax entity by the Customer and Customer will ensure that Google will receives payment for its services for the net amount as would otherwise be due (the VAT inclusive price less the local VAT withheld and remitted to applicable tax authority). </span></p>
    <p><span>2.3.2 If required under applicable law, Customer will provide Google with applicable tax identification information that Google may require to ensure its compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. Customer will be liable to pay (or reimburse Google for) any taxes, interest, penalties or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by the Customer.</span></p>
    <p><span>2.4 </span><span class="maps-underline">Invoice Disputes &amp; Refunds</span><span>. Any invoice disputes must be submitted before the payment due date. If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to Google, Google will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If the disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Google will apply the credit memo amount to the disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance due on that invoice. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all claims relating to Fees unless claimed within 60 days after charged (this does not affect any Customer rights with its credit card issuer). Refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Google and will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates Google to extend credit to any party.</span></p>
    <p><span>2.5 </span><span class="maps-underline">Delinquent Payments; Suspension</span><span>. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by Google in collecting such delinquent amounts. If Customer is late on payment for the Services, Google may suspend the Services or terminate the Agreement for breach under </span><span>Section 11.2 (Termination for Breach).</span></p>
    <p><span>2.6 </span><span class="maps-underline">No Purchase Order Number Required</span><span>. Google is not required to provide a purchase order number on Googles invoice (or otherwise).</span></p>
    <h3 id="3-license"><span>3. </span><span class="maps-underline">License</span><span>. </span></h3>
    <p><span>3.1 </span><span class="maps-underline">License Grant</span><span>. Subject to this Agreement's terms, during the Term, Google grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, license to use the Services in Customer Application(s), which may be: (a) fee-based or non-fee-based; (b) public/external or private/internal; (c) business-to-business or business-to-consumer; or (d) asset tracking.</span></p>
    <p><span>3.2 </span><span class="maps-underline">License Requirements and Restrictions</span><span>. The following are conditions of the license granted in Section 3.1. &nbsp;In this Section 3.2, the phrase Customer will not means Customer will not, and will not permit a third party to.</span></p>
    <p><span>3.2.2</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="maps-underline">General Restrictions</span><span>. Unless Google specifically agrees in writing, Customer will not: (a) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to </span><span>extract any or all of the source code (except to </span><span>the extent such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law); (b) sublicense, transfer, or distribute any of the Services; (c) sell, resell, or otherwise make the Services available as a commercial offering to a third party; or (d) access or use the Services: (i) for High Risk Activities; (ii) in a manner intended to avoid incurring Fees; (iii) for activities that are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) maintained by the United States Department of State; (iv) on behalf of or for the benefit of any entity or person who is legally prohibited from using the Services; or (v) to transmit, store, or process Protected Health Information (as defined in and subject to HIPAA).</span></p>

    <p><span>(b) </span><span class="maps-underline">Attribution</span><span>. &nbsp;Customer will display all attribution that (i) Google provides through the Services (including branding, logos, and copyright and trademark notices); or (ii) is specified in the Maps Service Specific Terms. Customer will not modify, obscure, or delete such attribution. </span></p>
    <p><span>(c) </span><span class="maps-underline">Review of Customer Applications</span><span>. At Googles request, Customer will submit Customer Application(s) and Project(s) to Google for review to ensure compliance with the Agreement (including the AUP).</span></p>
    <p><span>3.2.4 </span><span class="maps-underline">Restrictions Against Misusing the Services</span><span>. </span></p>
    <p><span>(a) </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="maps-underline">No Scraping</span><span>. &nbsp;Customer will not extract, export, scrape, or cache Google Maps Content for use outside the Services. For example, Customer will not:</span><span>(i) pre-fetch, index, store, reshare, or rehost Google Maps Content outside the services; (ii) bulk download geocodes; (iii) copy business names, addresses, or user reviews; or (iv) use Google Maps Content with text-to-speech services. Caching is permitted for certain Services as described in the Maps Service Specific Terms.</span></p>
    <p><span>(b) </span><span class="maps-underline">No Creating Content From Google Maps Content</span><span>. Customer will not create content based on Google Maps Content, including tracing, digitizing, or creating other datasets based on Google Maps Content.</span></p>
    <p><span>(c) </span><span class="maps-underline">No Re-Creating Google Products or Features</span><span>. Customer will not use the Services to create a product or service with features that are substantially similar to or that re-create the features of another Google product or service. Customers product or service must contain substantial, independent value and features </span><span>beyond the Google products or services. &nbsp;For example, Customer will not: (i) re-distribute the Google Maps Core Services or pass them off as if they were Customers services; (ii) create a substitute of the Google Maps Core Services, Google Maps, or Google Maps mobile apps, or their features; (iii) use the Google Maps Core Services in a listings or directory service or to create or augment an advertising product; (iv) combine data from the Directions API, Geolocation API, and Maps SDK for Android to create real-time navigation functionality substantially similar to the functionality provided by the Google Maps for Android mobile app. </span></p>
    <p><span>(d) </span><span class="maps-underline">No Use With Non-Google Maps</span><span>. Customer will not use the Google Maps Core Services in a Customer Application that contains a non-Google map. For example, Customer will not (i) display Places listings on a non-Google map, or (ii) display Street View imagery and non-Google maps in the same Customer Application.</span></p>
    <p><span>(e) </span><span class="maps-underline">No Circumventing Fees</span><span>. &nbsp;Customer will not circumvent the applicable Fees. For example, Customer will not create multiple billing accounts or Projects to avoid incurring Fees; prevent Google from accurately calculating Customers Service usage levels; abuse any free Service quotas; or offer access to the Services under a time-sharing or service bureau model.</span></p>
    <p><span>(f) </span><span class="maps-underline">No Use in Prohibited Territories</span><span>. Customer will not distribute or market in a Prohibited Territory any Customer Application(s) that use the Google Maps Core Services.</span></p>
    <p><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="maps-underline">No Use in Embedded Vehicle Systems</span><span>. Customer will not use the Google Maps Core Services in connection with any Customer Application or device embedded in a vehicle. For example, Customer will not create a Customer Application that (</span><span>i</span><span>) is embedded in an in-dashboard automotive infotainment system; and (</span><span>ii</span><span>) allows End Users to request driving directions from the Directions API.</span></p>
    <p><span>(</span><span>h</span><span>)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="maps-underline">No Modifying Search Results Integrity</span><span>. Customer will not modify any of the Services search results.</span></p>
