    <h1>Scout®</h1>
    <p><i>Please read these terms and conditions of use ("Terms of Use") carefully before you launch Scout® ("Scout") on your wireless device. Your use of Scout indicates that you accept these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not launch or otherwise use Scout.</i></p>
    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Use represent the agreement ("Agreement") between you and Telenav, Inc. ("Telenav") with respect to Scout. All references herein to "you" and "your" means you, your employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also be bound by this Agreement.</p>
    <p>Telenav may revise these terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice to you. You should visit <a href="http://www.telenav.com">www.telenav.com</a> from time to time to review the then current terms and conditions for Scout.</p>
    <h2>SCOUT</h2>
    <p>Scout allows you to obtain via your wireless device GPS-assisted navigation instructions to destinations throughout most of the United States or Canada, depending on your cellular carrier. Use of Scout requires payment of a monthly fee, which includes download to your wireless device of the Telenav GPS Navigator software and any upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto (collectively, "Telenav Software"), but does not include any hardware that may be required for certain wireless devices (such as a standalone GPS receiver). A complete description of Scout is available at the Products link on Telenav's website, located at <a href="http://www.telenav.com/products/tn/">www.telenav.com/products/tn/</a>.</p>
    <p>Scout is for your internal business and personal use and is not for resale or other transfer or disposition to any other person or entity.</p>
    <p>Scout utilizes map and other data licensed to Telenav by third parties for the benefit of you and other end users. This Agreement includes end-user terms required by these companies (set forth at the end of this Agreement), and thus your use of Scout is limited by and subject to such terms.</p>
    <p>Use of MyMileage within Scout is subject to additional terms located at <a href="http://www.telenav.com/legal/terms-of-use.html">www.telenav.com/legal/terms-of-use.html</a>.</p>
    <h2>YOUR LOCATION AND ROUTE INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>For Telenav to provide Scout, Telenav must record your route information, including your point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow, and must periodically receive your GPS location from the GPS hardware associated with your wireless device.</p>
    <p>In using Scout, you allow Telenav to access your GPS hardware and otherwise obtain this location and route information, and to record, compile and display such information internally. Such information is subject to Telenav's privacy policy located at <a href="http://www.telenav.com">www.telenav.com</a>. Your use of Scout indicates that you accept the terms of Telenav's privacy policy.</p>
    <p>If you are using Scout with Ford Applink: (1) you allow Ford Motor Company to access your vehicle GPS hardware and send your GPS location to Telenav so that Telenav may record, compile and display GPS location and route information internally; and (2) your use of Scout with Ford Applink indicates your consent to Ford Motor Company accessing your vehicle GPS along with the serial number of the SYNC module, and sharing your GPS with Telenav (for information on SYNC, see your Owners Guide). If you do not want Ford to access your vehicle GPS, do not use Scout with Ford Applink.</p>
    <h2>SAFE AND LAWFUL USE OF SCOUT</h2>
    <p>You agree to comply with the following when using Scout:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive safely.</li>
        <li>Use your own personal judgment while driving. If you feel that a route suggested by Scout instructs you to perform an unsafe or illegal maneuver, places you in an unsafe situation, or directs you into an area that you consider to be unsafe, do not follow such instructions.</li>
        <li>Do not input destinations, or otherwise interact with Scout, unless your vehicle is stationary and parked.</li>
        <li>Do not use Scout for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement.</li>
        <li>Arrange all GPS and wireless devices and cables necessary for use of Scout in a secure manner in your vehicle so that they will not interfere with your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device (such as an airbag).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>PAYMENT</h2>
    <p>Before your paid Scout application will be activated, you must: (i) provide Telenav with a valid major credit card (American Express, VISA or MasterCard); (ii) enter into a direct billing or prepaid agreement with Telenav; or (iii) subscribe to Scout through your wireless telephone carrier, and agree to pay the relevant charges to such carrier.</p>
    <p>You agree to pay all fees charged to your account for Scout (including applicable state and local taxes), in accordance with Telenav's billing terms in effect at the time the charge becomes payable. You will be charged such fees each month, even if you do not use Scout. Telenav reserves the right to change the fees for Scout at any time, upon prior notice to you.</p>
    <p>If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your credit card charge is returned to Telenav for any reason, or you otherwise fail to pay the charges for Scout when due, Telenav reserves the right to pursue any and all legal remedies to collect the amounts owed by you, and to suspend or terminate your access to Scout.</p>
    <h2>TELEPHONE CHARGES</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for any fees assessed by your wireless telephone carrier to access Scout, including any data plan charges, toll, out-of-area, roaming, or other telephone connection charges. Standard messaging rates and other charges may apply when using certain features in Scout, such as Shared Address.</p>
    <p>Telenav reserves the right to change at any time the phone number designated for you to access Scout, including eliminating any toll-free numbers.</p>
    <h2>TERMINATION</h2>
    <p>Telenav reserves the right to terminate your access to Scout at any time for any or no reason and without notice to you.</p>

Any such cancellation by you shall become effective upon Telenav's receipt of your notice. </p>
    <p>Upon any termination of your subscription of Scout, Telenav shall have no liability to you or any further obligations under this Agreement, other than to provide you with a refund in accordance with Telenav's then current refund policy, unless such termination is for cause. For a copy of Telenav's refund policy, visit <a href="http://www.telenav.com">www.telenav.com</a>.</p>

    <p>If you provide Telenav with any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Telenav has reasonable grounds to suspect so, Telenav has the right to suspend or terminate your access to Scout.</p>
    <p>All of your account information, as well as other payment and personal information provided by you to Telenav, is subject to Telenav's privacy policy located at <a href="http://www.telenav.com">www.telenav.com</a>.

    <p>This license shall terminate upon any termination of this Agreement, or upon any suspension, termination or cancellation of your access to Scout.</p>

    <p>You agree not to do any of the following:</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>DISCLAIMERS</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by Scout or the Telenav Software. You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of Scout and the Telenav Software.</p>
    <p>Scout and the Telenav Software are provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind either express or implied. Telenav disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
    <p>Applicable law may not allow certain warranty exclusions, so one or more of the above disclaimers may not apply to you.</p>
    <h2>OTHER QUALIFICATIONS</h2>
    <p>You understand and agree that the Telenav Software is downloaded to your wireless device at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damages to your wireless device, or loss of data, that results from the download of such software.</p>
    <p>Telenav does not warrant that Scout or the Telenav Software will not infringe on third party intellectual property rights.</p>
    <p>Telenav also does not warrant that your use of Scout will be uninterrupted or error-free. Rather, temporary interruptions of Scout may occur from time to time (such as when you drive into an area that has no cell phone coverage or when Scout or your carrier's network is undergoing maintenance). Telenav will exercise reasonable efforts to attempt to limit or prevent such occurrences, but in no event will Telenav be liable for any financial or other damages due to such interruptions.</p>
    <p>Telenav also does not warrant the accuracy of the map or other data used for Scout. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions.</p>
    <p>Telenav has technological and operational security policies and procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction, but Telenav makes no representations or warranties regarding the security of Scout or the transmission of data or information to and from Telenav and your wireless device. Telenav will not be liable to you or anyone else in the event of any unauthorized infiltration of any of its systems.</p>
    <h2>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
    <p>To the extent permitted under applicable law, under no circumstances shall Telenav or its licensors (or their licensors and suppliers) be liable to you or anyone else for any loss, injury, or damages (including but not limited to any compensatory, punitive, special, incidental, indirect, exemplary or consequential damages) arising out of or in connection with the use by you or anyone else of Scout or the Telenav Software, any defects in Scout or the Telenav Software, or any breach of this Agreement, even if Telenav or its licensors have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
    <p>Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.</p>
    <h2>INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
    <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold Telenav and its licensors (including their respective licensors, suppliers, assignees, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and the respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and representatives of each of them) free and harmless from and against any liability, loss, injury (including injuries resulting in death), demand, action, cost, expense, or claim of any kind or character, including but not limited to attorney's fees, arising out of or in connection with your use of Scout or the Telenav Software.</p>
    <h2>ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW</h2>
    <p>You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, Scout, or the Telenav Software, shall be settled by independent arbitration involving a neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator shall apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and the judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. Note that there is no judge or jury in an arbitration proceeding and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon both parties.</p>
    <p>This Agreement and performance hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the County of Santa Clara, California.</p>
    <h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
    <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Telenav and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
        Telenav's or your failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect that party's right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.</p>
    <p>If any provision herein is held unenforceable, then such provision will be modified to reflect the intention of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</p>
    <p>You may not resell, assign, or transfer any of your rights hereunder. Any such attempt may result in termination of this Agreement, without liability to Telenav. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Telenav may assign this Agreement to any affiliate at any time without notice.</p>
    <p>By using Scout, you consent to receive from Telenav all communications, including notices, agreements, legally required disclosures or other information in connection with Scout (collectively, "Notices") electronically. Telenav may provide such Notices by posting them on Telenav's website or by downloading such Notices to your wireless device. If you desire to withdraw your consent to receive Notices electronically, you must discontinue your use of Scout. Telenav may email or send text messages to you from time to time to inform you about our products and services that we think will interest you, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.</p>
