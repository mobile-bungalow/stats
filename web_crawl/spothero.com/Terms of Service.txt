<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>General Website Terms and Conditions</strong></h2>
<p>Thank you for visiting the SpotHero, Inc. ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">SpotHero</span>," "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">we</span>," "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">us</span>," or "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">our</span>") website at SpotHero.com (the "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Site</span>"). Your use of the information, materials, text, images and other content on the Site is subject to the terms and conditions below, which we may revise from time to time without notice. Please read these terms and conditions carefully. <strong>BY ACCESSING THE SITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE GENERAL WEBSITE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (THESE "TERMS AND CONDITIONS").</strong></p>
<p><strong>Services:</strong> Unless expressly stated otherwise, the services provided by SpotHero (the "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marketing Services</span>") are limited to informing users of the location and potential availability of certain parking spots ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parking Spots</span>") and facilitating Reservations (as defined below) by displaying Parking Spots, processing Reservations and collecting fees on behalf of Licensors (as defined below). Any fees and/or consideration paid to SpotHero is paid to SpotHero in connection with these Marketing Services unless otherwise indicated.  To be clear, SpotHero does not: (i) negotiate terms of licenses or settle disputes between users of the Site; (ii) provide a parking service; (iii) operate a parking lot or other parking facility; (iv) otherwise accept custody of motor vehicles; or (v) provide services other than the Marketing Services (collectively, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Excluded Services</span>"). The Excluded Services are provided by Licensors who are neither our agents nor acting in our behalf and we have no responsibility whatsoever regarding the safety of persons or property in the Parking Spots or any facility where the Parking Spots are located found through use of the Site. We are not responsible for any consequences arising from the Excluded Services, including, without limitation, consequences arising from not being able to park or delays associated with parking, road closures or changing traffic conditions.  Although we do not guarantee the availability of a specific Parking Spot, if a booked Parking Spot is unavailable at your time of reservation, we will attempt to locate an alternative Parking Spot, provide you with a refund and/or otherwise resolve any issues in accordance with our standard customer service policies and procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Licensors; Licensor Terms and Conditions:</strong> SpotHero lists the Parking Spots on the Site and, as such, facilitates the reservation of Parking Spots ("<u>Reservations</u>") between users of the Site ("<u>Licensees</u>" or "<u>you</u>"), and the independent owners, lessors, managers or operators of the Parking Spots (the "<u>Licensors</u>"). SpotHero does not establish the prices for Parking Spots, operate Parking Spots, or determine parking availability provided by Licensors. While SpotHero makes every effort to provide accurate information regarding the Parking Spots listed on the Site, at times such information may become inaccurate and SpotHero shall not be liable for any such inaccuracy. In all cases, your utilization of a Parking Spot will be governed by Licensor's customer agreements or policies in place from time to time, including, without limitation, all terms and conditions related to the use of any Parking Spot, any payment terms and conditions and all rules and restrictions imposed by the Licensor on the relevant parking facility and/or Parking Spot, as each may be entered into or effected in accordance with the Licensor's standard operating procedures (the "<u>Licensor Terms and Conditions</u>"). </p>
<p>By making a Reservation, you agree in all cases to abide by the Licensor Terms and Conditions. In connection with our provision of the Services, Licensors may represent and warrant to us that they have full authority to list the Parking Spots for Reservations. We are not responsible for confirming whether any such representation or warranty is true and correct, nor are we responsible if any such representation or warrant becomes inaccurate or incomplete prior to your use of a Parking Spot. In addition, SpotHero will never be responsible for any agreement or other arrangements between you and any Licensor, regardless of whether such agreement or other arrangements are related to your booking and use of a Parking Spot.</p>
<p><strong>User Accounts:</strong> In order to access certain areas of the Site, you will create a user account and login (a "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">User Account</span>").  You agree that all information which you provide through the Site in connection with creating your User Account or otherwise is current, accurate and complete. You are solely responsible for all activity that occurs with respect to your User Account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your User Account and keeping the username and password to your User Account secure. You agree to notify us immediately of any security breach or unauthorized use of your User Account. We will not be liable for any costs, losses, claims or damages that you or any third party incur which are directly or indirectly caused by any unauthorized use of your User Account.  You agree to never use another party's User Account without such party's express written authorization</p>
<p><strong>Use of Content:</strong> The text, images, data, illustrations, files, audio and video clips, designs, documents and other materials and content (collectively, the "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Content</span>") on the Site is our property and may be protected by copyright and other restrictions. Copyrights and other proprietary rights in the Content may also be owned by parties other than us. You may not copy, modify, distribute or otherwise use any of the Content, except for your personal and non-commercial use. Please note that we may withdraw any Content from the Site at any time in our sole discretion.</p>
<p><strong>User Warranty:</strong> By downloading, printing, or otherwise using any of the Content, you agree that you will (i) restrict your use of such Content to personal and non-commercial use, (ii) comply with all of these Terms and Conditions, and (iii) not violate our rights or the rights of any other person or entity. We do not warrant that use of any of the Content will not infringe the rights of third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial Use is Restricted:</strong> Unauthorized commercial publication or exploitation of text, images, documents, materials or any other Content is prohibited without our express written consent. If you wish to use any of the Content for commercial use, publication, or any purpose other than personal use, you must obtain our express written permission prior to such use. We may, in our sole discretion, grant permission for such use on a case-by-case basis and we may charge a usage fee for such use.  Without limitation of the foregoing, you agree that you may not sell, convey, license, sublicense, or resell or attempt any of the foregoing.</p>
<p><strong>Fees and Payments:</strong>  You are responsible for all charges, fees, duties, taxes, and assessments arising out of any Reservation, the use of a Parking Spot, the Marketing Services or the use of the Site. You agree to pay to SpotHero all fees for (including any overage fees) for SpotHero's provision of the Marketing Services, in accordance with the pricing and payment terms presented to you for such Marketing Services. Where applicable, you will be billed using the billing method you select through your User Account management page. Except as provided in these Terms and Conditions or when required by law, all fees paid by you are non-refundable SpotHero may change the fees for any Marketing Services, including any Marketing Services billed pursuant to a Subscription (as defined below), at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> In the event that any of the Marketing Services are billed on a Subscription basis ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subscriptions</span>"), you will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis (each period, a "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Billing Cycle</span>"). Billing Cycles are typically monthly or annual, depending on what Subscription you select when purchasing a Subscription. Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each Billing Cycle unless you cancel auto-renewal through your User Account management page, or by contacting our customer support team. While we will be sad to see you go, you may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription at any time, in which case your Subscription will continue until the end of the then-current Billing Cycle before terminating.  If SpotHero changes the fees for any Marketing Services billed pursuant to a Subscription, the change will become effective only at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.  SpotHero will provide you with reasonable prior written notice of any change in fees to give you an opportunity to cancel your Subscription before the change becomes effective.</p>
<p><strong>Taxes and Overage Fees:</strong> In connection with facilitating your transaction, SpotHero will charge your credit card for the total reservation price, which includes the amount for the Parking Spots, a fee retained by SpotHero for providing their services in facilitating the Reservations, and all anticipated applicable taxes.  SpotHero retains a service fee as compensation for facilitating reservations and for providing Marketing Services.  The amounts paid to the Licensors in connection with your reservation include all anticipated applicable taxes for the Parking Spots.  The Licensors are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions.  SpotHero is not a vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities nor a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom SpotHero reserves its customer's Parking Spots. If you are required by law to withhold any Taxes from your payments to SpotHero, you must provide SpotHero with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments. Unless otherwise stated, any overage fees incurred by you will be billed in arrears on a monthly basis. Overage fees which remain unpaid for 30 days after being billed are considered overdue. Failure to pay overage fees when due may result in the applicable service being limited, suspended, or terminated (subject to applicable legal requirements), which may result in a loss of your data associated with that service.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellations and Refunds:</strong> Reservations purchased through the Site are fully refundable up to 24 hours before the start of the Reservation unless noted otherwise. You can cancel a Reservation for any reason before that time unless noted otherwise.  Within 24 hours of the start of the Reservation, all Reservations are non-refundable, regardless of your use or non-use of the Reservation and regardless of any circumstance surrounding the use or non-use of a Reservation (i.e., traffic or weather delays, cancellation of a related event). </p>
<p>SpotHero may from time to time partner with third parties ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Partner</span>"), and Reservations purchased on Partner websites are not refundable for any reason.</p>
<p><strong>Promotional Marketing Incentives:</strong> SpotHero may from time to time issue promotional marketing incentives in the form of promotional codes, promotional discounts, coupon codes, Referral Credits (as defined below) or other marketing incentives ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marketing Incentives</span>").  The Marketing Incentives are given for no exchange of value or other consideration and you therefore have no ownership interests or rights in the Marketing Incentives.  For this reason, SpotHero reserves the right to deactivate any Marketing Incentive at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited, to mistake, failure to maintain an updated online account, unauthorized use or suspicion of fraud or abuse of any promotional program or Marketing Incentives.  Further, SpotHero reserves the right to terminate or discontinue any promotional program or other program offering Marketing Incentives at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Referral Program:</strong> If you choose to use our referral program ("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Referral Program</span>") to tell a third party (the "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Referral</span>") about the Site in exchange for the opportunity to earn promotional codes for Marketing Services("<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Referral Promotional Codes</span>"), we will ask you for the Referral's name, email address and other information. We will automatically send the Referral a one-time email inviting the Referral to visit the Site. We store the Referral's information for the purpose of sending this email and tracking the success of our referral program. You may only earn Referral promotional codes totaling up to $200 within one year of earning your first referral reward. Once you have reached the $200 limit (which limit may be increased or decreased at any time in SpotHero's sole discretion), you will no longer receive promotional codes for any Referrals until one year after your first earned reward. SpotHero reserves the right to deactivate any Referral promotional codes at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, mistake, failure to maintain an updated online account, unauthorized use or suspicion of fraud or abuse of the Referral Program or the Referral promotional codes in any way. Referral promotional codes are given for no exchange of value or other consideration, and are strictly promotional vouchers with no monetary value. Referral promotional codes must be redeemed by you or the Referral, as applicable, within 18 months after provided by SpotHero to you or the Referral, as applicable, or they shall be forfeited.  Further, SpotHero reserves the right to terminate or discontinue the Referral Program at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SpotHero may administer the Referral Program itself or may use a third party service to fulfill referral promotions at its discretion.  In the event that SpotHero uses a third party service to administer its referral program, participation in such program shall be subject to the program terms and conditions provided through such third party service.</p>
