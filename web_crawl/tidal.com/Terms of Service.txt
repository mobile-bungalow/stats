<h2 id="ref-introduction">1.  INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This document (the “Terms”) together with the <a href="/us/privacy_us">U.S. Privacy Policy</a> (collectively the “Agreement”) sets out the terms and conditions governing visits, access and use of the music service TIDAL by the end user (“you”). The term “you” includes additional registered users whenever permitted under the applicable subscription, visitors, and others who access or use any of the Services.</p>
<p>The “Services” means the music service branded TIDAL, mobile and device applications and all services provided by TIDAL or TIDAL’s vendors, or other third parties with whom TIDAL (as defined herein) contracts to provide the Services that are inherently related to the music service TIDAL or that are compatible for similarly situated digital music services. These may include, but are not limited to websites and applications for desktops, tablets and mobile handsets, set-top boxes and stereo equipment. The Services also include your ability to edit certain Service Content (as that term is defined in Section 8, below) that is specifically cleared for such use (the “Editable Content”) and User Content (as that term is defined in Section 9, below), and save such edited Editable Content and User Content to your own playlist without the ability to share or otherwise reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, or publicly display such edited Editable Content and User Content (the “Edit Functionality”). Each instance of edited Editable Content or edited User Content shall be deemed a “Remix” hereunder.</p>
<p>The Services are provided by Aspiro AB and Project Panther US LLC and their affiliated entities, and each of their present, former and future parents, predecessors, successors, assignees, subsidiaries, owners, officers and directors (whether acting in such capacity or individually), agents and attorneys (collectively, “TIDAL,” “we” “us” and/or “our”). You may contact us at: TIDAL – Customer Support, 1411 Broadway, New York, NY 10018, or by email at support@tidal.com.</p>
<p>The current Agreement will appear on our website with the effective date that the Terms and/or Privacy Policy were updated. TIDAL may, in its discretion, make changes to the Agreement. When we make material changes to the Agreement, we will provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, for example,&nbsp;by sending you an email. Your continued use of the Services after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully. If you do not wish to continue using the Services under the new version of the Agreement, you may terminate the Agreement by contacting us at support@tidal.com.</p>
<h2 id="ref-prerequisites">2.  PREREQUISITES FOR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE</h2>
<p>You need access to the internet in order to use the Services, and any cost for accessing the internet shall be paid by you. This also applies when using the Service via mobile phone, tablet, or other personal device capable of internet connection. If you use the Services via mobile telephone you should familiarize yourself with applicable data transfer costs for your mobile carrier plan. TIDAL does not have any responsibility or liability for data transfer costs you may incur when using the Services. We cannot guarantee that the Services will work with all devices.  Please visit <a href="https://support.tidal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005872445-System-Requirements">https://support.tidal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005872445-System-Requirements</a> for more information about our compatibility specifications.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you are able to comply with the relevant system requirements described above. TIDAL accepts no responsibility for any lack of functionality that is due to your equipment (including your device, internet connection, operating system or settings and software). Access to parts or all of the Services may be restricted from time to time to allow for repairs, maintenance or updating.</p>
<p>You may not use the Services in any way that is fraudulent or illegal or is expressly prohibited by these Terms. By using the Services, you promise to us that you accept these Terms and that (a) you are 18 years of age or over; or (b) you are between the age of 13 and 17, and have express permission from your parent or guardian to use the Services. If you are under age 13, you are not permitted to use the Services or to submit any personally identifiable information to TIDAL. If TIDAL reasonably believes that you have not told us your true age, we may suspend your use of the Services until you have provided us with acceptable proof of age. If you are a parent or guardian and believe TIDAL may have inadvertently collected personal information from your child, please notify TIDAL immediately by sending an email to Tidal – Customer Support at support@tidal.com detailing the basis of your belief and your request.</p>
<p>The Service requires you to register and create an account for validation. You agree to (a) provide accurate, current and complete information as prompted by any registration forms on the Services; (b) maintain and promptly update such information and any other information provided to TIDAL, to keep it accurate, current and complete; (c) maintain the security of your password and identification; and (d) be fully responsible for all use of your account and for any actions that take place using your account.</p>
<p>TIDAL reserves the right to suspend or remove your account or prohibit your use of the Services, without responsibility or liability to you, if activities occur on your account that we believe breach the Agreement.</p>
<h2 id="ref-purchase">3.  PURCHASE, PRICE INFORMATION, PAYMENT TERMS AND REFUND POLICY</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <em>Subscription.</em> Certain aspects of the Services provided by TIDAL, third parties, or both may require you to purchase a subscription for a period of time as specified during sign-up (collectively a “Subscription”). Your Subscription, which may start with a thirty (30) day trial period, will automatically renew on a monthly or annual basis (as specified during your sign-up) unless you cancel your Subscription as provided in Sections 3(e) and 3(g), or we terminate your Subscription as provided in Section 18.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <em>Bundles.</em> TIDAL may contract with a third party telecommunication provider to provide the Services to you through a bundle package together with other services provided by such third party provider. The payment terms for such bundle package, as well as other terms and conditions governing your use of the bundle package, may differ from the terms set out in this Agreement. You are solely responsible for reviewing such bundle terms or any other terms governing your use of the services provided by your telecommunication provider before agreeing to any bundle package and accessing the Service via such bundle package. If you have purchased a bundle package, payment will be taken from you by your telecommunication provider. Should you wish to cancel or terminate your subscription via such bundle package or obtain any further information in respect of payment methods, billing cycles, automatic renewals or refunds you must contact your provider. Other than this sub-section (b), Section 3 of this Agreement does not apply to you if you have purchased the Services as part of a bundle package from your telecommunication provider or any other third party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <em>Promotion/Trials.</em> TIDAL, vendors, or other third parties with whom we contract to provide the Services may offer special promotions/trials with differing conditions and limitations which may be subject to different terms from these Terms. Any additional terms to these Terms will be disclosed at sign-up or in other communications made available to you prior to sign-up. You are solely responsible for reviewing any additional terms governing your use of such special promotions or trials before accessing any special promotions or trials. At the end of the free or promotional trial period, your subscription will automatically renew for further rolling subscription periods of such duration as set out in the product details when you signed up for the trial or promotion and you will start to pay for the subscription. To avoid any charges, you must cancel before the end of the free trial. You are entitled to only one free trial per lifetime. Any attempt to utilize more than one free trial is an unauthorized use of the Services and/or Service Content and amounts to a breach of the Agreement. If TIDAL determines, in its absolute discretion, that you have utilized more than one free trial, TIDAL reserves the right to terminate your access to the Services, Service Content, and/or the Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <em>Shopping in the Store.</em> It is not necessary to buy a Subscription to make a purchase at the TIDAL Store. To make a store purchase, you will be prompted to sign in to your account. If you do not have an account, create a free account and choose a username and password. Upon completion of the Store purchase, the purchased music or album will appear in your account for download.  You can download TIDAL Store purchases on one device only. Once downloaded, your in-store purchase will no longer be available in your account. All shopping in the Store is final. You are responsible for backing up each purchase in the TIDAL Store&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <em>Payment Methods.</em> In connection with any and all Subscriptions that you select to purchase you must provide TIDAL with a current, valid, accepted method of payment, which may change from time to time ("Payment Method"). All Subscription purchases are subject to this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions, including any fees, imposed by your financial services provider and/or mobile carrier, as applicable. You are solely responsible for reviewing the terms of use, privacy policy or any other terms governing your use of the services provided by your financial services provider and/or mobile carrier. By providing a Payment Method in connection with any Subscription, you hereby authorize TIDAL to debit the total cost of said Subscription and agree to be responsible for any foreign transaction charges associated with your Subscription purchase. Should charges for which you are responsible fail at the time payment is required, you may be responsible for costs associated with TIDAL’s efforts to collect amounts due in accordance with applicable laws. You represent and promise to us that all information you provide in connection with the purchase of a Subscription is true, accurate and complete. The duration and cost of Subscriptions are set by TIDAL in its sole discretion. When you purchase a Subscription, you will initially be charged at the rate applicable at the time of your initial agreement to subscribe. If the price of the Subscription increases later, we will provide you with written notice before the end of the billing period in which the change is made. If you do not accept the change to your Subscription, you will be entitled to terminate this Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) <em>Billing Cycle.</em> As indicated during sign-up, the fee for certain Subscriptions must be paid in a single upfront payment while other Subscriptions may allow payment on an installment basis. If the Subscription fee is paid in a single upfront payment, the total Subscription fee is due and payable to TIDAL immediately upon sale and your Payment Method will be automatically billed at that time. If the Subscription fee is paid on an installment basis, your Payment Method will automatically be billed at the beginning of each installment period as specified during sign-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) <em>Automatic Renewal.</em> In order to provide continuous service, you agree that TIDAL will automatically renew a Subscription on or about the date the Subscription expires. Such renewal will be for the same duration of the original subscription term and will be billed at the non-discounted rate for the Subscription as of the date of your enrollment and according to your original billing cycle method (i.e. either as a single upfront payment or an installment basis). By enrolling in a Subscription, you agree that your Subscription will be subject to the above-described automatic renewals unless you cancel your Subscription in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. You also agree that the amount billed may be different if your original Subscription was purchased using a promotional/trial offer and you authorize TIDAL to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts as indicated at the time of sign-up.  You agree that you are responsible for other charges, including any foreign transaction charges, that may be imposed by credit card providers, payment processors or other third parties in connection with your use of the Subscription. Your Subscription will remain in effect and continue to renew automatically until it is cancelled.</p>
<p>IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS MANAGED THROUGH TIDAL (AND NOT THROUGH A THIRD PARTY) AND YOU WISH TO CANCEL YOUR AUTOMATIC SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL, you may do so by visiting your account settings page (<a href="/account">https://tidal.com/account</a>), going to the section called “Subscription” and clicking on “Cancel my subscription”. TIDAL will make reasonable efforts to process cancellation requests within two business days from the receipt of the cancellation request. All other cancellations are required to be made directly through the third party that manages your TIDAL Subscription.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) <em>Refund Policy.</em> We will not refund any fees paid to us, including any advance charge(s) or payment(s) for any subscription term for the Services, unless otherwise required by law or the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) <em>Charge Backs.</em> If you dispute Subscription charges with your credit card company or financial institution, and TIDAL’s investigation determines the charges were valid, we may, on reasonable written notice to you, charge to your TIDAL account the reasonable required cost of responding to your charge back request. TIDAL’s U.S. Privacy Policy details what information TIDAL may share with your financial institution as part of the investigation into disputed Subscription charges.</p>
<h2 id="ref-special">4.  SPECIAL OFFERS</h2>
<p>If you have received or purchased access to the Services as part of a special offer, campaign or a partner deal (a “Special Offer”), then the terms presented as part of such Special Offer are a part of this Agreement. Special Offers will, unless otherwise specified, only be valid for customers in the country (and state(s)) where it is issued.</p>

<h2 id="ref-governing">19. GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES</h2>
<p>Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to one or more of the following: (1) the Agreement; (2) the Services or Service Content, including User Content; (3) your Subscription; or (4) any products or services sold or distributed by TIDAL or through TIDAL (collectively “Claims”), will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you and TIDAL may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. You and TIDAL also agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights unrelated to your use of the Services or Subscription.</p>
<p>This Arbitration Provision is intended to be given the broadest possible meaning under the law and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable U.S. federal arbitration law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <em>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</em></p>
<p>Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action or proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claims. Any relief awarded cannot affect other users of the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <em>Arbitration Procedures</em></p>
<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, the arbitrator may award the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs), except that the arbitrator cannot not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow and enforce the Agreement.</p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Claim relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Provision including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator will decide any and all Claims—statutory, common law, or otherwise.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with AAA’s rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules available at  <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/document_repository/Consumer_Rules_Web_0.pdf">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/document_repository/Consumer_Rules_Web_0.pdf</a>. If there is any inconsistency between the AAA rules and this Arbitration Provision, the terms of this Arbitration Provision will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Provision terms would result in a fundamentally unfair arbitration.</p>
<p>To commence arbitration, you must complete a short form, submit it to the AAA, and send a copy to us, Attn: TIDAL Legal Department, 1411 Broadway, 39th Floor, New York, NY 10018. For more information, see the AAA’s claim filing page, <a href="https://www.adr.org/fileacase">https://www.adr.org/fileacase</a>. You may represent yourself in the arbitration or be represented by an attorney or another representative. Once we receive your arbitration claim, we may assert any counterclaims we may have against you.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be held in New York, New York, or at another mutually agreed location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <em>Costs of Arbitration</em></p>
<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. You and TIDAL will be individually responsible for all other costs and fees incurred in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all attorneys’ fees, unless recoverable under applicable law. However, in the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse us for all fees and costs associated with the arbitration, including our attorneys’ fees, and fees and costs paid by us on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <em>Severability</em></p>
<p>If the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Provision other than Section 19(a) (Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief) is invalid or unenforceable, you and TIDAL agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Provision shall be enforceable as so modified. If the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of Section 19(a) is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void. The remainder of the Agreement will continue to apply.</p>
<p>If for any reason Claims proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and TIDAL waive any right to a jury trial. In that instance, you expressly agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the State of New York, County of New York.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <em>Future Changes to this Arbitration Provision</em></p>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and TIDAL agree that if we make any change to this Arbitration Provision (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against TIDAL prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if future version of this Agreement do not contain this or another Arbitration Provision, any existing Arbitration dispute will not be affected.</p>
<h2 id="ref-miscellaneous">20. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
<p>There is no agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and TIDAL or between TIDAL and any other user of the Services. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of any other provision of the Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect unless such deletion materially frustrates the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will terminate. Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Agreement. No waiver shall be effective against TIDAL unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, give any person who is not a party to it any right to enforce any of its provisions.</p>
<p>TIDAL intends to rely on this Agreement, including the applicable Privacy Policy, and any notices regarding the Services sent to you or posted on the Services. If you require any changes to the Agreement, such changes must be expressly agreed to by you and TIDAL in writing. This will help avoid any problems about what you expect from TIDAL and what TIDAL expects from you.</p>
